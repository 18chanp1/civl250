**_Is so-called Hate Language in Social Media Related to Engineering and Sustainability?_**

Use of hate language in social media is related to engineering and sustainability, because social media was a medium for communication created by engineers. PLATO was one of the first social media sites, incoporating concepts such as forums, message boards, email, chatrooms, and video games. This system was created by Professor Don Blitzer, who had three degrees in electrical engineering [1].  Even today, engineers continue develop and maintain many social media platforms. For example, Facebook plans to hire 10,000 engineers in europe to develop the metaverse. [2] Therefore, engineers play a significant role in the continued development and growth of social media.

Hate language can have serious conseqeunces for members of the public. According to the UN, the proliferation of hate language exposes people to "abuse including violdence, social and economic cohesion, peace and development... wide scale human rights violations, including atrocity crimes."[3] In fact, hate speech has been a precursor to genocides around the world, such as Cambodia and Rwanda [5]. Because of the grave potential for harm that arises from hate speech, it is important that we address and mitigate hate speech. We must also recognize that not all hate speech leads to harm, and we should balance hate speech against freedom of expression.

Engineers are obligated to protect the public from harm, especially as engineers are tied to the development of social media. According to EGBC's  (the governing body for engineers in B.C.) code of ethics, which engineers are obligated to follow, engineers must *hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public, the protection of the environment and promote health and safety within the workplace.*[4] For this reason, engineers are obliged to protect the public from the potentially serious harms of hate speech.

"_development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs_."

Hate language is also related to sustainability, as hate speech often leads to violence, impeding peace, stability, justice, which is strongly related to sustainable development goal 17 (peace, justice, and strong institutions) set out by the UN. [5] In addition, instability and hate can often be an impediment to socioeconomic development, preventing people from working together. Hence, sustainability is an important aspect to think about when considering hate speech.

While engineering is a significant part of social media, it is important to acknowledge that engineers are oftentimes unsuited to make descisions about hate speech. While engineers may be proficient in highly technical aspects of their field, such as developing programs and preparing drawings, engineers are not experts in policing hate speech. For example, how do engineers determine whether something is or is not hate speech, how we deal with hate speech, and how do we balance hate speech against freedoms of expression. As engineers, we are also obligated to understand our limits in expertise, and to consult with other experts if we do not have the skills to police hate speech. For this reason, we delegate this task to the legal system[6] to determine what is hate speech and the sanctions against it. In that case, we could argue that engineers should leave responsibility of managing hate speech to law-enforcement and the legal system, since there are mechanisms in place to manage hate speech. Thus, engineering is not significantly related to hate speech in social media.
