**Which three of the five trends in the list below are major trends that have occurred within the global community since 1948?**

1.  The world population has grown dramatically since 1948
2.  The percent of the world population killed due to armed conflict is greater now compared to 1948.
3.  People across the world (i.e. the world population's average per-person level of health) are healthier now compared to 1948.
4.  People across the world are wealthier now compared to 1948.
5.  The percentage of the world population killed as a result of terrorism is greater now compared to 1948.

The answer is: 

*Trends 1, 3, and 4 listed above.*

It turns out that there are many fewer deaths due to military conflicts now compared to just after world war II. (see figure 2 in :[https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Dupuy%2C%20Rustad-%20Trends%20in%20Armed%20Conflict%2C%201946%E2%80%932017%2C%20Conflict%20Trends%205-2018.pdfLinks to an external site.](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Dupuy%2C%20Rustad-%20Trends%20in%20Armed%20Conflict%2C%201946%E2%80%932017%2C%20Conflict%20Trends%205-2018.pdf))

We actually don't know how many people were killed via terrorism in 1948. But there was certainly terrorism happening ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_terrorismLinks to an external site.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_terrorism)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_terrorism).))

Data on world-wide terrorism began to be collected in 1970 by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Response to Terrorism in the US. In 1970, about 0.00003% of the world population was killed by terrorism. The percentage in 2016 is 0.0003%. Bummer.

**Take a guess at whether or not the following statement is true or false: The total material footprint for North America was lower in 2010 compared to 2008.**
*True*. 

If you visit [https://sdg-tracker.org/sustainable-consumption-productionLinks to an external site.](https://sdg-tracker.org/sustainable-consumption-production) and scroll down to the animation of the material footprint (MF) data, you will see that the MF for Canada did not change from 2008 to 2010 and the MF for the US _DECREASED_! So the answer to this True/False question is the statement is True!

**Complete the following IPAT equation: per person GHG Emissions - (number of people) x (kg manufactured goods used per person) x (?)**

*GHG emitted per kg material*

As long as you understand that the correct answer has the same meaning as "GHG emitted per kg material consumed", you are doing ok. Don't worry if the courseware is telling you that your answer is incorrect because your answer isn't completely identical to the answer I've put in the courseware tool.

Importantly, note how engineering influences the impacts of human activities. That is, engineers influence impact by designing technologies that reduce both the amount of material consumed by each person and also by designing technologies that reduce or eliminate GHG emissions during the production of the materials used by people.

Of course, thinking more critically about the IPAT equation, one can observe that it does not refer to the life-cycle of technology, nor whether or not the consumption is of material extracted from nature or recycled material. So the equation provides a good start for how to think about the role that engineers can play in sustainable development - but for engineers, it is an over-simplification.

It's worth noting that the impacts of GHG emissions are felt over both the short and the long term, and that they include both direct and indirect impacts.

For example, consider that a tangible impact of population growth, affluence, and technology is an increase in the size of the global fleet of automobiles. 

**Which of the following are some short term and direct impacts of this large fleet of vehicles? 

1.  Increased per-person mobility (It's a lot faster to get to the hospital if you go by ambulance compared to if you walk!)
2.  Cities are quieter (wink, wink).
3.  Increased number of injuries due to increases in car crashes.

1,2,3


**Which of the following are long-term and indirect impacts of the increasing number of automobiles on the roads?**

1.  Climate change.
2.  Decrease in per-capita health because fewer people are getting exercise by walking.
3.  Quieter cities (wink, wink, again)

1,2,3

**You have probably heard about sustainable development a lot in your previous studies. How do you define the term?**

Well, this is an open-ended question of course. But the characteristics of your working definition should be consistent with those that are well established. No matter what you response to this question, your definition should consider refer to:

-   development (i.e. improving lives)
-   needs (as opposed to wants)
-   future impacts:
    -   both short and long term impacts of current actions
    -   both direct and indirect impacts of current actions

**Aside from Goals 6, 7, 9, 11, which 4 SDGs do you think are most relevant to engineering practice? (i.e. the achievement of which 4 goals does engineering have the greatest capacity to help?) Why?**

*all*

Goals 6, 7, 9, and 11 have obvious connections to engineering. The choice of which of the remaining 13 goals relate most to engineering is open-ended (there are lots of open-ended questions in CIVL 250!).

Perhaps your response to this question will depend on which engineering discipline you are studying or how you view engineering (if you are not an engineering student). That's just fine. (This question is really aimed at getting you going on your SRL project.)

For me, *all the remaining goals are related to engineering* in one form or another!  Hmmmm, seems like this might be a good discussion question!

**Which of the following statements describe ways in which carrying capacity and biocapacity are similar?**

1.  The unit of measure for both terms is area.
2.  The unit of measure for both terms is population.
3.  Both terms are used within the context of sustainable development.
4.  Both terms describe an area of land.

*The correct answer is 3 and 4.*

Both carrying capacity and biocapacity describe the capacity of an area of land to contribute to sustaining human life.

On the one hand, biocapacity describes the the capacity of an area to be productive. (For example, the Arctic certainly supports life, but its productive capacity is very wide-spread and the harvest capacity is low. Therefore the Arctic has low biocapacity.) Biocapacity is calculated by mulitplying the area of land by a dimensionless number that represents the yield factor of the land.

On the otherhand, carrying capacity describes the capacity of an area to support human lives. The unit of measure is population. The biocapacity of an area will determine it's carrying capacity.

**What reduction in EF is necessary for the average Canadian to live within the planet's biocapacity?**

~ 4 Global Hectares

Incorrect : 1.5, 6, 10, 15

**The global average per-capita EF in 2018 was greater than the average in 2014.**

False

# 1.3
**From the list below, identify two impacts of climate change that are currently being observed.**

1.  Decreasing yields of agricultural crops
2.  Increases in human population
3.  Number of infant deaths per 100,000 people
4.  Changes in ocean species.

*1,4 are correct*

**What role does poverty play in terms of vulnerability to climate change impacts?**

*Poverty makes people more vulnerable to climate change impacts.*

For example, poverty can result in living in a flood plan or living out in the open and these situations make a person more vulnerable to climate change impacts like floods, droughts, and heat stress. In other words, poor people lack the resources to protect themselves from climate change impacts.

**From the list below, identify three factors that influence the risks associated with climate change.**

*1,4,5 are correct*

1.  Vulnerability
2.  Assets
3.  Seasons
4.  Hazards
5.  Exposure
6.  Location

**Describe the relationship between mitigation of climate change and adaptation to climate change.**

Both mitigation and adaptation can reduce the risk of climate change.

Adaptation and mitigation are complementary activities in reducing climate change risk. *Adaptation manages risk in the near future (i.e. the short term), while mitigation helps reduce future risks*. Investing in mitigation leads to future adaptation option for managing climate change risks.

Note that, unlike the IPPC video on which this question is based, we don't always think of climate change in terms of risk. Yet, since always need to prioritize investments, it makes sense to put effort to lower the risk levels for those at highest risk of impact.

**From the list below, identify an adaptation to climate change that is already in place in many areas of the world.**

1.  Increased bicycle routes in cities.
2.  Flood barriers and improvements in drainage.
3.  Evacuations from low lying countries.

*2 is maybe correct*

While many cities in the world are increasing the number and quality of their bicycle routes, this is a mitigation strategy aimed at reducing GHG emissions from transportation vehicles (and also reducing future health costs :))

Similarly, there are certainly evacuation plans in place for low lying countries, like the Maldives. But, to date, no countries have been evacuated in response to flooding caused by climate change.

However, significant flooding has occurred around the world due to climate change (for example the 2019 flooding in Mozambique due to cyclone Idai). As a result flood barriers and improved drainage are being built in vulnerable areas.

Another example of adaptation is the installation of air filters in British Columbian buildings in order to clean otherwise smokey air from wild fires caused by climate change.

**What is the primary activity in Durban South Africa aimed at mitigating climate change?**

Reforestation of an old landfill site, as described in the IPCC video.

The best activities addressing climate change are integrated with other activities. For example, the reforestation in Durban South Africa utilizes existing people, resources and workstreams, to sequester carbon and restore ecosystem services, while also strengthening community engagement, and providing employment and training for individuals.

**The Paris Agreement refers to "NDCs", which is an abbreviation of "Nationally Determined Contributions".**

*True*

Do you know what Canada has committed to?

Canada states in its NDC that it will pursue an economy-wide target to reduce GHG emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Canada has indicated that it may also use international credits to meet its target. Considering the upward trajectory of the upper bound of the current policy projection, Canada may need to use a large quantity of international credits to meet its target.

**Convert 34 kgs of atmospheric N2O into equivalent kgs of atmospheric CO2.**

34 kgs of N2O are equivalent to 10,540 kgs of CO2.

The calculation is:

(34 kg N2O) x (310 CO2e/kg N2O) = 10,540 kgs CO2e

Wow! That's a lot of CO2e!

**What are the three components of biodiversity?**

The three components of biodiversity are:

1. ecosystem diversity

2. species diversity

3. genetic diversity

**Approximately what percentage of the Earth's animal (non-human) populations have been lost since 1970?**

*60%*

Other incorrect options: 75%, 45%, 15%, 30%

**Which of the following is NOT a major cause of biodiversity loss?**

*Increases in aeroplane traffic*

Other incorrect options: Water borne pollutants, unsustainable hunting, decreasing wild lands to to increased human land use

**Biodiversity loss improves ecosystem health by ensuring abundant food supply for surviving species.**

*False*

This is a false statement. In fact, biodiversity reduces ecosystem resilience which, in turn, likely leads to lower ecosystem health.

**What are ecosystem services?**

Ecosystem services are benefits to humans provided by healthy ecosystems. They include:

-   Air and water purification;
-   Waste decompostion;
-   Soil and nutrient cycling;
-   Climate and radiation regulating;
-   Habitat Preservation (we won't have crops if pollinators don't have habitat)
-   Noise Reduction;
-   Aesthetic and culture;
-   Raw materials and products
