# 1.1.1 The context
The idea of sustainability has existed for eons and lives on today within many of the world's Indigenous cultures. But post-industrial human development, particularly since the early 1950s, has generated a growing global focus on sustainable development.  Why all the fuss?

The 4-minute video below explains how the world has changed since the industrial revolution.  It emphasizes the global changes in population, wealth, and health that have occurred since the 1950s.

## In 1810
Most countries sick and poor
Life expectancy ~ 40 in most countries

UK and netherlands slightly better

Industrial revolution makes countries in Europe and elsewhere leads to improvements in health and income

Colonized countries remain

## 1900
Countries get healthier

### 1910s
Slow improvement due to first world war and spanish flu epidemic

### 1930s
Western countries improve
Japan and others try to follow
Most continue to remain

### 1940s
1948 - End of war
Increasing inequality in health and income

USA -> Japan -> Brazil -> Iran (from oil money) -> China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh

### 1960s
Colonies gain independence, improvements in health
### 1970s
Countries in asia and latin america catching up with western countries (emerging economies)

### 1980s - 2000s
African countries stuck in civil war, HIV, but some improve


## Summary of Today
Most people live in the middle
huge inequalities between countries and within countries as well.

e.g. Shanghai vs Guizhou
Rich as rich as Italy, poor as poor as Ghana

Remarkable progress
Historical gap between west and world is closing
New converging world


*Continued convergence*
Coming from aid, trade, green technology and peace

Everyone can be healthy and wealthy. 

# 1.1.2 World Population Growth
![[1.1populationProjection.jpg]]

It's no surprise that the total human population on earth is increasing.  But it's worth taking a look at the data and considering the rate of growth we are experiencing.

So it looks like the world's population will be around 10 billion by the end of your working career (i.e. around 2055).  This is astounding when you think that this INCREASE (i.e. about 3 billion more than today's population) is about the same as the TOTAL world population in 1960!

# 1.1.3 Increasing per capita consumption

All living beings consume the earth's resources, including humans

The average european has consumed increasingly more resources throughout time. 

*Reasons:*
- Living longer
- Being wealther -> more consumption

Canada has highest rates per capita of material consumption around the world.

*Graph of extracted material per capita*
Based on consumption habits
Includes biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores, and non-metal ores. ![[1.1 footPrintperCapita.jpg]]



# 1.1.4 Impacts
During your working career, increases in the global population and per-person material consumption rates will lead to significant societal, biophysical, and economic changes.  

One very simple way of thinking about these changes is to consider the IPAT equation.  

IMPACT = (POPULATION) x (AFFLUENCE) GDP per capita x (TECHNOLOGY) CO2e per dollar

The original intent of the equation was to describe environmental impacts.  However it can also be used to describe social impacts.

There is no assumption in this equation that impact is positive or negative - only that the degree of impact on people and the ecosystems on which we depend is a function of the population size, the wealth of the population, and the technologies used by the population.

The Impacts we are now observing include:

-   Infant mortality rates have decreased dramatically since the 1990s
-   Green house gas emissions have dramatically increased since the 1950s
-   Dramatic biodiversity loss is now occurring due to climate change and also habitat loss (because people are taking over more and more fertile lands)
-   Air and water quality is decreasing
-   Education rates are increasing
