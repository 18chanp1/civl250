# 1.2.1 Introduction
In 1987, faced with indications of growing inequity across the world and also serious environmental devastation, including increasing evidence of anthropogenic climate change, the United Nations brought to the world's attention the idea of sustainable development, which they defined as "_development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs_."

It's a constructively ambiguous definition that, consequently, has spawned other important definitions and concepts that you need to learn in order to understand and participate in engineering for sustainable development.

This Lesson introduces a small number of definitions and concepts that will get you on your way!

# 1.2.2 SDGs

![[1.2 SDGs.bmp]]

Each goal has several well-defined global _**targets**_ aimed at guiding national sustainable development strategies. And each target is associated with one or more indicators that measure progress toward the target.

Consider Goal 9. It has 8 targets and, for each target, 1 or 2 indicators of progress. Here is target 9.4 and its only indicator:

| Goal 9 | Target 9.4 | Indicator 9.4.1 |
|:---|:---|:----|
|_Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation._| _By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities._ |CO2 emission per unit of value added |

At this point, please take some time to become familiar with at least 4 SDGs by going to the website below. There you will find an interactive tool that helps you get an overview of the SDGs.

It turns out that your self-regulated learning term project will focus on connecting several SDGs to an engineering activity (e.g. a "green" or sustainable technology) of your choice, so I suggest you begin your project now by perusing through the interactive website describing each SDG. At the very least, read through the first page of the url above.

# 1.2.3 Carrying capacity
Within the context of Sustainability, "_**carrying capacity**_" is the number of people who can be supported over a very long period of time (e.g. several millennia), by the natural, social, human, and built capital existing within a specified area. People / Area

The term originates from the language of ecologists who define the "carrying capacity" of an ecosystem as the population size that can be supported indefinitely by the available resources and services within that ecosystem. In this context, living within the carrying capacity of the ecosystem depends on:

-   the amount of resources available in the ecosystem,
-   the amount of resources consumed by each individual within the population.

A term that is related to, but different from, carrying capacity is "_**biocapacity**_".  This measure represents the productivity of land areas, including forests, pastures, cropland, and fisheries.  These areas, if left unharvested, can also absorb much of the waste generated by humans, especially, they can sequester (i.e. absorb) atmospheric carbon.

**_In 2010, the Earth's total biocapacity was estimated as 1.7 hectares per person._**

# 1.2.4 Eco footprint
How much of the biological capacity of the planet is required by a given human activity or population?

This was the question asked by Dr. Bill Rees and Mathis Wackernagel at UBC, back in the early 1990's.  To answer the question, these two scientists developed the measure called "Ecological Footprint" (EF).

The EF is a measurement of the current human demand on the earth's ecosystems. In essence, it provides an estimate of the area of biologically productive land and sea needed to _sustainably_ support human activities in a given year.  The unit of measure is (area/year).

Below is an EF info graphic.  Here you can see that the Earth's biocapacity is comprised of the ability to absorb (i.e. sequester) carbon, the land available for buildings, forests, cropland and pastures, and fisheries.  

![[1.2footprint.bmp]]

A country's ecological deficit is calculated as the difference between the total ecological footprint of its population and it's biocapacity of the area available to that population. According to the Global Footprint Network's 2019 report, 86% of humanity lives in a country that is in ecological deficit. 

### Per-Capita Ecological Footprints

So your personal EF is the total productive land and sea area needed to provide the renewable resources you are using, and to absorb the waste you produce, - every year.  Go to the following url to estimate your personal EF.

[http://www.footprintcalculator.org/ (Links to an external site.)](http://www.footprintcalculator.org/)

The average ecological footprint for a Canadian is about 5.9 global hectares (per year).  (Note that this means your footprint calculation is being calculated based on the total global productive land, - instead of, for example, the total productive land within Canada.)

Here is a map illustrating average national ecological footprints

![[1.2globalFootprint.bmp]]

The average Ecological Footprint per person world-wide is 2.6 global hectares. The good news is that this is less than the average EF per person in 2014!  

### Interpreting Ecological Footprint Data

Unfortunately, the earth's total productive land and sea area available (i.e. the current global biocapacity) is about 1.7 global hectares per person (2010 data).  

Since the average person has a footprint of 2.6 global hectares, there is evidence that the earth cannot sustain current human activities over the long run.

Ecological Footprint analysis, as well as other scientific analysis (for example, climate change modelling), provides convincing evidence that we need to move toward creating more sustainable technologies and ways of living.  Engineers have an exciting role to play in the coming years!

**_For CIVL 250, you need to be able to define the term "ecological footprint". You do NOT need to understand the methodology used to calculate EFs._** 

However, many students are just plain curious about how Eco-footprints are calculated (after all, calculations are what engineers do best!).

# 1.2.5 Natural Capital

> _Natural capital is the land, air, water, living organisms and all formations of the Earth's biosphere that provide us with ecosystem goods and services imperative for survival and well-being. Furthermore, it is the basis for all human economic activity._

_from:  Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, written by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins in the late 1990's._

The term "natural capital" is analogous to the term "financial capital".

Just as the most secure financial position is to spend interest generated by capital investments, so too the most secure environmental position is to use natural resources in such a way as to ensure their abundance is maintained or even increased over the long-term.

**Note**: _the above definition of natural capital is offered by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) website: [http://www.iisd.org/library/natural-capital-approach-concept-paper (Links to an external site.)](http://www.iisd.org/library/natural-capital-approach-concept-paper) and excerpts from the Hawken, Lovins & Lovins book are available here: [http://www.natcap.org/sitepages/pid20.php](http://www.natcap.org/sitepages/pid20.php)_
