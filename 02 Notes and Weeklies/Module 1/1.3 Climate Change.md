As you know from 2018 news headlines, climate science now indicates that global GHG emissions need to be dramatically reduced by 2030 in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

![[1.3risingTemps.bmp]]

The need to limit the average global surface temperature increase to 1.5 degrees celsius before 2030 is argued by climate scientists who spend a lot of time creating a variety of models aimed at predicting future climates. The models are used to predict possible (and probably) impacts of climate change on the average global surface temperature, and also the consequences of this climate change on human activities. This scientific analysis is published in peer-reviewed journals.  

The scientific papers published in these peer-reviewed journals are compiled by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is comprised of several hundred global-climate scientist experts, governance experts, engineering experts, and others. IPCC members work together to develop possible and practical mitigation and adaptation strategies.

Every few years, the IPCC publishes a report containing summaries of the models and predictions, along with analyses of the accuracy of the predictions.  The report also includes suggested actions that would change the predictions toward a more desirable future. In the fall of 2018, the IPCC published a special report that explains why we need to act quickly. Here is the report url: [https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ (Links to an external site.)](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/)

The 2014 IPCC report includes short videos that explain the latest understanding of impacts, as well as possible responses to climate change.  One of these videos is provided below.

This lesson's "Just for Fun" quiz has several questions about this 12 minute video. Take a stab at the quiz while watching the video, making sure to pause as necessary in order to complete the quiz.

#### **CIVL 250 does not require that you explain the science of climate change. However, the course assumes you have familiarity with the concept. You should have at least _an introductory-level understanding of climate change and its effect on:_**

-   atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions
-   global average surface temperature
-   annual minimum area of Arctic sea ice
-   area of land ice
-   sea levels

#### **_If you do not understand the so-called "greenhouse effect" and/or you do not understand the connections between the greenhouse effect and the indicators of climate change listed above, please review this information on the NASA climate change sites:_**

# 1.3.2 Paris
*The 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 21)*

COP21, which took place in 2015, resulted in a truly landmark agreement on December 12 in Paris.  This agreement (called "the Paris Agreement"), was adopted by 195 countries and aims to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2oC and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 oC.

Some of the key outcomes of COP21 are that 195 countries (representing over 95% of the world's population) have agreed to:

-   limit the average surface global temperature increase to well below 2o Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while aiming to limit the increase to no more than 1.5o;
-   Establish binding commitments by all parties to make "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs), and to pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving them;
-   Commit to regularly reporting national emissions and "progress made in implementing and achieving" their NDCs, and to undergo international review;
-   Extend the current goal of mobilizing $100 billion a year in support to poorer countries by 2020 through 2025, with a new, higher goal to be set for the period after 2025;
-   Call for a new mechanism enabling emissions reductions in one country to be counted toward another country's NDCs.

After the Paris agreement was signed, 55 countries that, together, accounted for at least 55% of current global GHG emissions, ratified the agreement with votes in their legislative assemblies, and the agreement came into full force in the spring of 2016.

On August 4, 2017, one of the biggest global emitters of carbon dioxide, The United States of America, notified the United Nations that it is withdrawing from the international agreement.  

The U.S. move highlights _the complexity of sustainability activities because they invariably involve multiple players and an array of perspectives._

Governments in Canada and elsewhere are now calling on all sectors, and especially the business sector, to work together to achieve the goal of limiting GHG emissions, and thereby meet the goal of limiting the global temperature change to less than 2oC by the end of this century. In this context, it's interesting to watch the political wrangling between Canada's federal government and some of its provinces regarding the imposition of a federal carbon tax. The devil is certainly in the details!!   

The call by all levels of Canadian governments to reduce GHG emissions - regardless of political strip - represents a significant opportunity for the engineering profession (i.e. YOU!), in partnership with others, to ensure that the commitments made in Paris are kept on track.

## 1.3.3 Global Warming potentials
During engineering projects, engineers should be concerned about the amount of Green House Gases (GHGs) emitted during the life-cycle of the project.

A GHG is any gas in the atmosphere which absorbs and re-emits heat and thereby keeps the atmosphere warmer than it otherwise would be. Some GHGs are naturally occurring in the atmosphere but human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are increasing the concentrations of GHGs, which then leads to climate change and global warming.

**MEASURING GHGS**

The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of a GHG is an index expressing the amount of atmospheric warming a gas causes over a given period of time in comparison to carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, one kg of methane (CH4) in the atmosphere causes 21 times more warming compared to one kg of CO2, over a 100 year time period. And so CH4 has a GWP of 21. Here are the GWPs of all GHGs.

![[1.3warmingPotential.bmp]]

Many human activities (e.g. driving a car) emit mixtures of GHGs and it is often useful to measure these emissions in terms of a common unit. The standardized common unit is CO2 Equivalents or CO2e. For any quantity and type of GHG, CO2e signifies the equivalent amount of CO2 which would have the equivalent global warming impact.

Any amount of GHG can be expressed as CO2e by multiplying the mass amount of GHG by its GWP.

# 1.3.4 Carbon footprint calculations
The term "carbon footprint" describes the contribution to global warming of a human activity.  Strictly speaking, it is measured as the area of productive land and sea required to sequester (absorb) the equivalent CO2 emitted by the activity.  In this case, its unit of measure is Global Hectares.

However, it is very common to measure a carbon footprint simply as the tonnes of atmospheric Green House Gases (GHGs) emitted into the atmosphere by a particular activity or organization.  In this case, its unit of measure is Tonnes CO2e.

Below is an estimate of the change in the total human Ecological Footprint (measured as a fraction of the earth's total area of productive land and sea) with time. The influence of carbon emissions is evident! (See **Module 1 - Lesson 2** for an introduction to the term _"Ecological Footprint"_.)

_For CIVL 250, you are expected to explain the term "carbon footprint" as described above.  While you may be asked to perform an over-simplified carbon footprint calculation in order to demonstrate your understanding of GWPs, you will not be asked to perform a detailed carbon footprint._  

However, I am sure you are interested in the details of carbon footprint calculations!  You will learn a little more about how carbon footprint calculations, and other similar calculations, are performed when we look at sustainable supply chains.  However, to find out more about these calculations now, please see the optional material below.

_**OPTIONAL:**  For those of you are really interested, have a look at this report on the carbon footprint of the proposed Site C Hydroelectric Dam that is now in construction in the Northeast corner of B.C.
