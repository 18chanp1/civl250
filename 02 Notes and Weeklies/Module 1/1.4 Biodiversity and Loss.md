# 1.4.1 Background
Biodiversity loss is now considered by scientists to be just as significance as climate change in terms of impacts from the drivers of sustainable development (i.e. the growing human population and per capita consumption rates). This lesson lays out the problem, including causes and impacts, then introduces a concept that we are beginning to employ as a means of maintaining and perhaps enhancing biodiversity, namely ecosystem services. Later in the course, you will learn some specific strategies beginning to be used in engineering practice that employ the concept of ecosystem services to enhance biodiversity. But first, scroll down this page to find the definitions of biodiversity and biodiversity loss.

**_Biological Diversity_**, or biodiversity, is described at length by Canada's well-recognized consortium on biodiversity established in 1992, [BioDivCanada. (Links to an external site.)](https://biodivcanada.chm-cbd.net/?lang=en&n=DABC84B3-1) Here are the fundamental aspects of biodiversity that you need to know:

-   Biodiversity refers to the variety of species and ecosystems on Earth and the ecological processes of which they are a part. Areas and regions are described as possessing or not possessing biodiversity.
-   There are three components of biodiversity, namely:
    -   ecosystems diversity
    -   species diversity
    -   genetic diversity
-   All of us depend on ecosystems. i.e. without healthy and resilient ecosystems, humans cannot survive.


**_Biodiversity Loss_** occurs naturally (i.e. in the absence of humans). Normally these losses are relatively low-level and do not necessarily result in gene pool or ecosystem loss. Sometimes, non-human influences can result in exceptionally large biodiversity loss, for example, in the case of the mass extinction of 75% of all species about 66 million years ago that scientists think was initiated by an asteroid impact. It appears that biodiversity loss recovers from such catastrophic events over time.

In the modern era (i.e. since the industrial revolution) and especially since the WWII (as shown in the plot below, which illustrates species population loss since 1970), the Earth has been experiencing its 6th mass extinction. Unlike other extinctions, this one is being caused by human activity. As shown below, 60% of the Earth's animal populations have been lost since 1970.![[1.4animalSpeciesLost.bmp]]

_The global Living Planet Index (LPI) shows a 60% decline from 1970 to 2014. The white line illustrates the index values and the shaded areas represent the 95% confidence intervals (Source: [Living Planet Report 2018: Aiming Higher (Links to an external site.)](https://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/all_publications/living_planet_report_2018/) published by the World Wildlife Foundation in partnership with the United Nations.)_

# 1.4.2 Causes
Climate change is sometimes considered the primary cause of biodiversity loss and, certainly, climate change is creating dead zones and consequent losses (for example, when a forest fire kills a forest located on a steep slope, the tree roots can no longer hold the soil, the soil slides off the slope, and the forest ecosystem is destroyed). However there are more significant causes of biodiversity loss.

1.  As the human population increases, we are razing wild lands to create farms, housing and industrial sites. 
2.  Poaching and unsustainable hunting
3.  Pollution, particularly water borne pollutants.

**_The details of these causes are beyond the scope of CIVL 250._** However, for those interested, take a look at these articles in the Guardian Weekly Newspaper, which describe examples:

1. [Increasing use of natural resources (e.g. wild lands) (Links to an external site.)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/23/earths-resources-consumed-in-ever-greater-destructive-volumes)
2. [Hunting (Links to an external site.)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/19/worlds-mammals-being-eaten-into-extinction-report-warns
3. [Pollution](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/14/uks-last-resident-killer-whales-doomed-to-extinction)

# 1.4.3 Impacts

_"The most unique feature of Earth is the existence of life, and the most extraordinary feature of life is its diversity. Approximately 9 million types of plants, animals, protists and fungi inhabit the Earth. So, too, do 7 billion people."_ 

(Quote from: "Biodiversity Loss and Its Impact on Humanity" [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11148 (Links to an external site.)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11148))

So, what happens to people when biodiversity dwindles?

The 2012 article in Nature, quoted above, reviewed 20 years of scientific publications in order to answer this question. The seventeen scientists who authored the paper summarized the influence of biodiversity on human activities.

Increases in biodiversity loss decreases the yield and/or quality of:

-   commercial crop yields;
-   wood production on plantations;
-   fodder (mostly cattle) production;
-   fisheries;
-   resistance of ecosystems to invasive plants;
-   resistance of native plants to fungal and viral infections ;
-   above ground carbon sequestration (i.e. chemical storage of atmospheric carbon);
-   soil quality.

**_The overall take away to remember is that biodiversity loss reduces the healthy function of ecosystems. This is not good for humans because we rely on the services that ecosystems provide._**

# 1.4.4 Ecosystem services
Ecosystem health is important because it turns out that ecosystems support humans at both individual (physical, mental, socioeconomic) and societal (socioeconomic, community) levels.

![[1.4ecosystemServices.bmp]]

This support to humans is provided by what biologists call "ecosystem services", which can be described in several different ways. For the purposes of CIVL 250, we will use the same terms used by land use planners namely, the services of:

-   Air and water purification;
-   Waste decompostion;
-   Soil and nutrient cycling (this is more important than you may think!);
-   Climate and radiation regulating;
-   Habitat Preservation (we won't have crops if pollinators don't have habitat)
-   Noise Reduction;
-   Aesthetic and culture;
-   Raw materials and products

In Module 4, you will find out how sustainable cities strive to ensure that ecosystem services are preserved and enhanced. Now it's time to complete the Module 1 lesson 4 practice quiz then move on to Module 2!
