**Imagine you grew up in Delta B.C. where your parents own and operate a land development company that is actively developing lands in that municipality. You recently graduated from UBC with a civil engineering degree and see that the Municipality of Delta is advertising an EIT position, so you eagerly apply to the position. With your excellent academic record, as well as experience working summers with the operations group in the Municipality of Richmond, you are confident that you have a good chance at getting the job. You go through the interview and, within a week, you receive the job offer with you enthusiastically accept.

**Accepting the position with the Municipality of Delta contravenes the EGBC code of ethics.**

*True*

On page 10 of the code of ethics, code 4, "Act as faithful agents of their clients or employers ..." is discussed. An excerpt from from this discussion is:

_Most but not all conflicts of interest arise out of business activities. Members should be careful in their business relationships in order that potential conflicts within their control are avoided. For example:_

_• a member with authority to recommend purchase of vehicles ought not own stock in an automobile manufacturer._

_• a geoscientist in a management position in the exploration division of a major oil company ought not hold stock in a seismic contractor._

_• an engineer employed by a municipality ought not have an interest in a land developer operating in that municipality._

_• a member ought not actively participate in organizations, lobby groups or voluntary committees detrimental to the employer s image and competitive position._

_Conflicts of interest extend to holdings of associates and to members of the professional’s immediate family including common-law spouse or companion._

_Where a conflict exists a member should take steps to mitigate it, including recommending the engagement of another professional to oversee the work. Such mitigation does not however erase the conflict — the best conduct is avoidance._


**You really enjoy living in Delta and the job seems perfect. Also, you know your parents, while still owners of the land development company, are selling the firm and plan to retire within a couple of years. 

**What should you do?**

*Decline*

According to the code of ethics, you could *decline* the job or, you could explain the conflict of interest with your potential employer, and, should you be hired, check-in with your employer annually to up-date him or her about the situation.

Perhaps it goes without saying that you should never accept work within the municipality that is directly related to specific land development projects of your parents' company!

**Which of the following is NOT an EGBC Sustainability Guideline?**

**According to academics, argumentation enables the exploration of ideas and concepts leading to at least temporary agreement on resolution to open-ended questions.**

*True*

**Consider the proposal to replace the George Massey Road Tunnel that connects Richmond to Ladner and South Surrey.

The following are excerpts from page 4 of the [2015 report commissioned by the Government of B.C. to review the tunnel. (Links to an external site.)](http://engage.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/52/2015/12/GMT-Project-Definition-Report-Dec-2015.pdf)**

***********************

### 1. Project Overview

...

_Since the Tunnel opened in 1959, Metro Vancouver’s population and economy have grown, and its population is forecast to continue to grow by more than one million people over the next 30 years.  Without improvements to this crossing, economic growth and regional livability will be constrained by congestion and increasing travel times for commuters, goods movers, commercial traffic and other traffic._

_With growing concerns about public safety and congestion in and near the Tunnel, in 2012, the government of B.C. commenced a study of options to address the Highway 99 corridor. After analysis and consultation, a new bridge to replace the Tunnel emerged as the most appropriate and supported solution. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2017._

#### _Need for a Replacement Crossing_ 

_**Reduce Congestion:** The Tunnel has been congested during weekday morning and afternoon rush hours for decades, with combined queues from all directions now regularly as long as five kilometres. When there is a crash or vehicle breakdown, these queues can be much longer. The volume of traffic at other times of the day has also grown to the point that the Tunnel is operating close to capacity throughout most of the day. Traffic studies indicate that if this crossing remains unchanged, then by 2045, peak-period queues will be three to five times longer than they are today. There will be more than a threefold increase in travel delays and a rush "hour" lasting at least four to six hours._

What argumentation component does each colour represent?

Your answer:

Red: Claim

Blue: Reason

Green: Evidence

I have coloured the font to distinguish phrases and sentences that state the claim (_red_), a reason (_blue_), and evidence (_green_). A warrant is the underlying assumption that the number of vehicles on the roads will continue to grow.

Do you agree with this analysis ?  

Another way of thinking about the presented argument is to suggest that the argument components are:

Claim: Tunnel congestion needs to be reduced

Reason: The tunnel is currently running at, are beyond, its capacity, thus causing long mobility delays.

Evidence: The evidence includes the current rush-hour delays, delays during an accident, and also predicted increases in delays over the next several years 

Warrant: The growing population will increase the number of vehicles on the road over the next 30 years.

The above interpretation is slightly different from the first interpretation in that the claim that was first identified is more broad and complex than the second claim.

A third claim that is also plausible is: The Massey Tunnel needs replacement.

You can can see that argument is open to interpretation and claims can be ambiguous. It's important to note that, while mis-interpretations or ambiguous statements can lead to disaster if one is dealing with details (i.e. detailed engineering) multiple interpretations and ambiguous statement relating to overall concepts (like guidelines or principles) can be constructive. For example, It's really good that Canadians agree that justice is a good thing.

**Immediately after earning their Professional Engineering designation, Irfan and Tom went into the solar panel business together.  They were approached by Winnie, a potential client, who shared with them a competitor's quote for building her solar collection project .  Winnie told Tom and Irfan that she would hire them if they could complete her project for less money that their competitor.  Irfan and Tom did some calculations and agreed to do the work for less than their competitor's quote.  **

**In accepting Winnie's proposal, Tom and Irfan contravened the Engineer's Code of Ethics.**

*True*

**Principle #7 of the code of ethics states that engineering should conduct themselves with fairness, courtesy and good faith towards clients, colleagues and others, give credit where it is due and accept, as well as give, honest and fair professional comment. Guideline (f) states that "Members should not compete improperly by reducing charges to underbid a fellow member after having been informed of that member’s charge. " In accepting Winnie's offer, Irfan and Tom would be contravening guideline f.**

**Kevin Okuda is the engineering manager for the the B.C. transportation commission, with a primary responsibility for highway road safety.  At least 1 person has died along a given stretch of road each of the last 7 years by crashing into a roadside tree.  Many other crashes have occurred.  Two law suits were filed regarding the unsafe segment of the road, but were dismissed because the drivers were exceeding the 80 kmph speed limit.   A recommendation to widen the road will result in cutting down about 30 mature trees.   Environmental groups protest, and file a petition signed by 150 people to save the trees.  Public debate falls on both sides of the issue.** 

**Choose the sustainability guideline that you think provides the most support for Kevin, as he thinks through what action to recommend.**

*Guideline 4*

This is an open-ended and complex question. Instead of choosing guideline #4 as described above, you may thing Kevin would be wise to carefully read the explanation associated with guideline 2: Integrate Sustainability into Professional Practice. For example, toward the end of the explanation, the guideline states: 

_"In recommending specific options, APEGBC professionals should not limit their considerations to only technical issues. For each task, APEGBC professionals should consider other implications that are within their field of expertise. Known and reasonably foreseeable cumulative implications should also be considered. Finally, decisions for sustainability require a consideration of the consequences of not only the proposed action, but also its products and by-products, including their final disposal."_
