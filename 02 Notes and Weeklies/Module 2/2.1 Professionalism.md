# 2.1.1 Obligation
The Engineers and Geoscientists Act of British Columbia outlines the professional responsibilities of Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia (EGBC).  EGBC Bylaws and the Code of Ethics (which are legally binding) guide and govern the actions of all Professional Engineers.  This material is available at:

[The Act: Bylaws and Code of Ethics](https://www.egbc.ca/About/Governance/The-Act,-Bylaws-and-Code-of-Ethics)

Section 14 (a), article 1 of the EGBC Bylaws outlines the engineers' and geoscientists' code of ethics.  The purpose of the code is to "_give general statements of the principles of ethical conduct in order that members and licensees may fulfill their duty to the public, the profession and their fellow members and licensees_".

The code states that engineers shall:

> "hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public, the protection of the environment and promote health and safety within the workplace"

**In other word, engineers are obliged, and have the legal authority, to consider sustainability in everything we do.**

Make sure you know the Code of Ethics and its guidelines.  It's a bit of a grind to read through (i.e. 33 pages!), but this part of your due diligence that gets you into the engineering profession.  In CIVL 250, you will likely be tested on your understanding of one of the aspects of the code.

# 2.1.2 Engineers and Society
The legislated authority of engineers to put sustainability into action as stated in our code of ethics comes from the place we hold within society.

As illustrated below, most of us work at the interface between human activities and the ecosystems on which society depends. Indeed, nowhere do humans dip into the natural capital* provided by the earth, where an engineer is not directing the activity of obtaining and using that natural capital!!

_(* Recall the definition of Natural Capital. The term was first developed by Hawken, Lovins, and Lovins, in their well-known book entitled Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (1999).)_

# 2.1.3 EGBC Sustainability
## The EGBC Sustainability Award

Helping members understand the engineering implications of our society's move toward sustainability is a major part of what EGBC does.  For example, the organization presents an annual Sustainability Award to an engineering project that embeds aspects of sustainability into its design goals.

As it turns out, the 2018 Sustainability award was bestowed on UBC for its new pool facility. Watch this three-minute video to learn more:

## The EGBC Sustainability Guidelines

In addition to highlighting engineering innovation that supports sustainability, EGBC has developed [Sustainability Resources (Links to an external site.)](https://www.egbc.ca/Practice-Resources/Sustainability/Sustainability-Resources) for Practicing Engineers, including 5 [EGBC Sustainability Guidelines: (Links to an external site.)](https://www.egbc.ca/getmedia/3686f97d-f6cf-41a1-9ca2-b99f298f15cf/APEGBC-Sustainability-Guidelines.pdf.aspx)

-   **Maintain a Current Knowledge of Sustainability;**
-   **Integrate Sustainability into Professional Practice;**
-   **Collaborate with Peers and Experts from Conception to Completion;**
-   **Develop and Prepare Clear Justification to Implement Sustainable Solutions;**
-   **Assess Sustainability Performance and Identify Opportunity for Improvement.**

**_For CIVL 250, it is expected that you are able to identify the five sustainability guidelines of EGBC_**.
