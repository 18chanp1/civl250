# 2.3.1 Introduction
SRL (also called _**life-long-learning**_) is important because sustainability-in-engineering practice is a relatively new component that has evolved and has grown considerably over the last twenty years, and is surely going to change even more over your working career.

So, by the time you graduate,you need to feel comfortable with **being your own teacher**. This doesn't mean becoming an expert overnight! It means that you possess the skill to determine what you need to learn and then you know how to gain the knowledge you think you need. By developing this skill, you can guarantee that you will continually improve your professional practice.

As a self-regulated learning, you have the skills to manage the stages of your learning.

Specifically, you:

-   -   set your learning goals,
    -   select strategies to attain your goals, 
    -   reflect on your progress toward achieving your goals 
    -   revise your goals or your strategies if necessary 
    -   self-evaluate the methods you have chosen to achieve your learning 
    -   adapt future methods based on what you learn this time (this recognizes that learning is cyclical)

To learn more about self regulated learning, study this diagram.

You will be asked to describe aspects of self-regulated learning on the CIVL 250 mid-term test and final exam. Also, you are asked to apply self-regulated learning skills in order to compete your SRL Term Project.

# 2.3.2 SRL Assignment
Most people find it challenging to develop the ability to direct one's own learning because it involves motivating oneself, self-monitoring and questioning oneself, and knowing the steps that lead to authentic learning without the constant oversight of a teacher.  Your SRL project is intended to help you move through the stages of learning on your own.

Here are the questions you should be asking yourself as you work on your term project:

-   _What do I want to learn from this project? What is motivating me to learn - i.e. why do I want to learn this?_
-   _What actions can I take that will lead to me achieving my learning goals? What learning strategies* can I use? What is my learning plan?_
-   _Am I watching myself progress toward my learning goals? Do I need to adjust my plan?_ 
-   _Are my learning strategies working for me?_ 
-   _Will I use a similar plan the next time I work on a project? (this recognizes that learning is cyclical)_

To help you progress through your SRL Project, the project is divided into five assignments. After each assignment, make sure to step back and ensure you are on track.

Now that you have read through this tab, start thinking about assignment 1 of your SRL project, which is due at the end of week 4.  

***Learning strategies include:**

-   _**Use UBC's [Assignment Calculator](http://assignmentcalculator.library.ubc.ca/index.php)** to help plan those big research papers and projects._
-   _**Try teaching or explaining to others**_ what you are learning (in your own words). Respond to their questions. Then have them tell you what they learned and compare this to your notes or the text. You really begin to understand something when you can teach others.
-   _**Make your study sessions short (about 30 min)**_ and sweet and give yourself 5 minute breaks, where you do something fun. Most university students can concentrate on studying for about 25-30 minutes. Working on the SRL project for a long time doesn't really mean you are studying hard or well.
-   _**Create a quiet study area free from temptation**_ (stay away from your bed, the TV and the fridge). Work on your project in the same place every time to create a routine, as this will force your brain to go into study mode automatically. This is especially helpful if you face a wall where you won't be distracted by outside sources.
-   _**Write SRL Project Assignment due dates on a calendar**_ so that you can visualize when you will be the busiest and plan accordingly.
-   _**Focus on** **building a daily plan**_ with a clear list of realistic to-dos and short focused chunks of studying or working on assignments.
-   _**Prioritize readings and assignments**_ based on their due date and level of importance.
-   _**Understand procrastination:**_ [https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/belonging-to-tomorrow-can-procrastination-be-a-good-thing/Links to an external site.](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/belonging-to-tomorrow-can-procrastination-be-a-good-thing/)
-   _**Ask good questions (of yourself and others).**_ Check your thinking by asking questions about what you’re learning. What’s being said? Who is saying it? Why are they saying it? Who else says this? What do I believe? Why do I believe it? What’s missing? Where is the error in this and how can I fix it? Why does another solution work better? Asking good questions helps us solve problems, make thoughtful decisions and think creatively. Adopting this practice can lead to insights that can open up doors in your thinking and improve your learning significantly.

-   _**Get enough sleep**_, as being tired will greatly impact your ability to retain information.
