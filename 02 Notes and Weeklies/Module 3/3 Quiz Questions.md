# 3.1

**What thinking framework is the foundation of traditional engineering practice?**

*Reductionism*

Incorrect Answers
Liberalism, conservatism, systems thinking


**Which of the following options DOES NOT describe a system (select each option in the list that IS NOT a system).**

Several marbles on a flat surface

A handful of toothpicks

Other Incorrect Answers:

A tree 

An atom

A car engine

A lake

A city

A wooden table

An ant

A Building

**The following list includes both simple and complex systems. Which of the systems below are simple systems?**

the international space station

a pinball machine

a gearbox

a wooden table

Except for the ameoba, all the options are simple systems. Because its actions are predictable, even the space station, while extremely complicated, is a simple system.

# 3.2

Complexity science tells us that complex systems have three common properties. What are they?

1. Complex systems consist of large networks of individual elements that each follow relatively simple rules with no central control or leader. (Think of a crowded road intersection in a city where people are mostly travelling on motor bikes but also walking, driving cars, and riding other vehicles.)

2. Information and signals from both internal and external environments are used and produced by complex systems.

3. Complex systems change their behaviour through learning or evolutionary processes.

**What is emergent behaviour?**

Emergent behaviour of a complex system is systems behaviour that is self-organized without a controller or leader. It is the result of system components following a simple set of rules and it is often unpredictable. (Think of your personality as an emergent behaviour of the behaviour of neurons in your brain. Another example is the shape of bird flocks.)

**What are the four stages of the adaptive cycle?**

**Rapid Growth (r)**

Social, economic or environmental resources are abundantly available and facilitate rapid growth. This phase tends to be fast.

**Conservation (K)**

Resources are no longer plentiful, slowing growth. This phase is slow with little capacity to change, making the system less flexible and vulnerable to collapse.

**Release/Disturbance (Ω)**

A disturbance causes the system to collapse. This is a quick, chaotic phase.

**Reorganization (α)**

Also a quick phase, the system may reorganize into a different structure after the collapse. New entities may be formed and innovation achieved.

Include revolt and background


**Describe one example of an adaptive cycle that involves humans.**

#### Example 1. The Adaptive Cycle of a Steel Bridge Design

The bridge preliminary design starts quickly using many human resources (rapid growth). The project moves to slower, detailed design with fewer human resources required (conservation). All of a sudden, steel prices spike and global supply drops (i.e. a distrubrance) and the decision is made to avoid the use of steel (collapse). A new design is started for a concrete bridge (reorganization).

#### Example 2. The Adaptive Cycle of Vancouver's Water Supply

Vancouverites pay for the provision of clean water (a resource) as part of their property taxes, with one fee per residential user paid, regardless of the volume of water consumed. Water remains plentiful (conservation), however Vancouver's population continues to grow. A very dry winter, spring and summer could spark a severe water shortage in Vancouver (disturbance), resulting in the implementation of a new water management framework with conservation and user-pay-per-volume as the new norm (reorganization).

Other examples are possible!!

# 3.3

**Given the definition of a system, which of the following items are the components (also called "parts" or "elements") in the system model presented in Tab 3.3 of lesson 3?**

Individual's transportation decisions
Components of the built environment
Physical health of individuals
Perceptions of the built environment

"Age, education, culture, etc., of individuals" describes an important contextual issue but is not emphasized in this model.

Note:

1.  Other models are possible. the one presented is offered by the author as one interpretation of the system.
2.  As demonstrated by this model, elements within a system model can be conceptual rather than physical. For example, in the Tab 3.3 model, "decisions" are portrayed as one element.

# 3.4

**Which of the following phrases is NOT part of the concept map shown in Lesson 4.2?**

Creativity is not needed to see inter-relationships between map segments.

Creativity IS needed to see inter-relationships between different segments in a concept map.

Non correct Answers:
organized knowledge is context dependent.
Concept maps represent organized knowledge.
Focus questions are context dependent
Concepts connected using linking words are used to form propositions

**Concept maps are constructed by following four steps.**
Compose a focus question
Create a ranked list of concepts
Construct a preliminary concept map
Add cross links

Other Incorrect Match Options:

-   Organize knowledge
-   Circle each concept
-   Create a scope statement
-   Add propositions
-   Define the knowledge domain

Causal loop diagrams consist of many arrows, where each arrow connects to variables. 

What is always associated with each arrow?
either a positive ("+") or a negative ("-") sign

For the multiple choice question below, CHOOSE THE BEST ANSWER!

**Causal look diagrammes can be used by engineers to try to identify unintended consequences of decision options, for example decisions associated with designs.**

**The most distinguishing feature of a causal loop diagramme is its:**

Feedback loops

Causal loops diagrams are helpful because they identify feedback loops in systems. Feedback loops are either reinforcing (e.g. increases in GHG emissions cause warming which, in turn causes more GHG emissions) or balancing (e.g. increases in births increases the population, which, in turn, causes more in deaths).

**Consider the CLD shown in Lesson 4.5 (i.e. 4.5 Reading CLDs).**

Which variable in the CLD represents biocapacity?

Natural resources capacity

Biocapacity represents the productivity of land areas, including forests, pastures, cropland, and fisheries. In other words, it is the capacity of natural resources.

**Which of the following technologies (i.e. engineering interventions) do you think might directly or indirectly benefit or harm the system described in the Module 3 Lesson 4.5 CLD?**

Increased pesticide production
Increased GHG emissions
Increased fertilizer production
Production of solar panels
Better stormwater drainage

The CLD in Module 3 Lesson 4.5 describes the systemic interconnections between the agricultural sector, natural resources and cities. 

The items _unrelated_ to these interconnections are:

-   improved display clarity in virtual reality headsets
-   faster printer speed

Admittedly, a creative person might be able to imagine a possible indirect connection between either of these two technological advancements and the CLD in question, but perhaps you would agree that such relationships would be remote, especially compared to the other interventions in the list.

# Weeklies
**Consider the relationships between a city's transportation system and human health.  Which of the following has NOT been shown to be a feedback loop between these two systems?**


A walkable transportation system improves community mental health and an improved level of mental health within a community increases advocacy for a walkable transportation system.

Incorrect Answers:
The perception that the local area is walkable may lead to increased walking, adn increased walking may increase awareness of the walkability of an area.
A walkable transportation system increases the likelihood that a person will choose to walk, and the habit of walking may increase a person's advocacy for a walkable transportation system.
Improving health increases the likelihood of a person choosing to walk and choosing to walk further increases the likelihood of good health.
Personal health is associated with a person's improved perception of the built environment, and an improved perception of the built environment can lead to a more active lifestyle which improves a person's health.

**In 2008, 75% of the United States corn crop was used to feed cows, chickens, and other livestock.  But, because of a 2009 change in US government policy aimed at increasing the production of renewable energy sources (in this case, corn-based ethanol), about 41% of the 2009 US corn crop was used to produce ethanol.  This increased demand for corn (due to its use as both livestock feed AND feedstock for ethanol production) led to a doubling of corn prices.**

**Using your skills as a "systems thinker", identify a LIKELY UNINTENDED and direct consequence of the 2009 change in US government policy aimed at increasing the production of renewable energy sources.**

Livestock farmers pay larger shares of their incomes to corn feed suppliers, thereby having less money to pay-down their debts, and many eventually go out of business.

Incorrect Answers
Livestock farmers pay larger shares of their incomes to corn feed suppliers, thereby having less money to pay-down their debts, and many eventually go out of business.
The 2009 policy has no unintended consequences.
Because renewable fuels are more accessibe, individual car owners drive more.
More fuel burned in the US is renewable, therefore the rate of increase in GHG emissions in the US is reduced.

The correct answer is that more farmers may go out of business due to rising feed costs. This possibility is directly related to the increased use of corn-based ethanol.

The other consequences described, while in-directly related to the increased production of corn-based ethanol, may be possible.

The take-away from this question is that complex systems may have direct and indirect consequences and that consequences are difficult, and sometimes impossible, to predict.


**Consider a set of nested circles, and imagine that each circle represents a sub-system within a techno-socio system.  Within this techno-socio system, where is engineering work most likely to occur.?**

*Within the inner-most sub-system (represented by the smallest diameter circle)*

Traditional engineering is based on working with complicated yet simple (i.e. predictable) systems. It is important that engineers understand that modelling for analysis purposes does not account the complexity in which engineering work is embedded.

Not Anywhere else

**The controls on an Airbus 380 airplane are complicated AND complex.**
False
The controls on an Airbus 380 airplane are complicated but they are predictable and re-producable and are therefore not complex.

**For engineers, one of the biggest challenges raised by sustainability is the need to translate broad sustainability goals into detailed engineering actions.  Concept mapping is a tool that can help the practicing engineer tackle this challenge with logic and structure.

**The first step in creating a concept map is to pose a "focus question" that relates to the domain of knowledge you wish to organize.  What are the three remaining steps that lead to the creation of a concept map?**

Create a ranked list of they key concepts

Construct preliminary concept map

Add cross-links

In addition to the 4 steps you have identified (review Lesson 4 if you are having trouble with this question), remember that the best concept map starts with general concepts and becomes more detailed as it becomes more branched.

The best concept maps are highly branched, provide several examples, and possess significant cross-links.

**Jordan is a country in the Middle East classified by the World Bank as an "upper middle income" country. Like many in this region of the world, it suffers from a lack of water.**

**Below is a PRELIMINARY concept map generated from the following focus question: "What should be considered in successfully managing Jordan's water problem?"**

**Please describe 5 cross-links that could be added to this concept map.  Your description of each cross-link should include the first concept, a linking word or phrase, and the second concept.**

**Site C**

Site C is a hydroelectric dam proposed for the Peace River in northern B.C.. Construction began on the dam in the summer of 2015, but had been controversial for several years before the provincial government consented to its construction.  More information on the project and its controversy are found at these two websites:

-   [https://www.sitecproject.com/about-site-c/project-overview (Links to an external site.)](https://www.sitecproject.com/about-site-c/project-overview)
-   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_C_dam (Links to an external site.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_C_dam)

This large engineering project encapsulates several techno-social issues, and is an example of where systems thinking can help understand the situation.

To practice organizing your thoughts around this project, try constructing a concept map:

Start with the following simple and constrained question:  "What is the sustainability context of the Site C project?"

Here is a ranked list (from the most general to the most specific) of concepts to put into the map - oh, wait - the list is far too long for this quick question. (The project is so darned complex!) Just create a map using about 20 concepts. Try to add cross-links!!

**Why is systems theory of interest to civil engineers?**

Because many issues cannot be effectively addressed through reductionist thinking alone, or to consider larger, indirect, and long-term impacts on systems.

**When we put on our “reductionist” hat, we might wonder why a tree produces so many millions of seeds over its lifetime when, typically, only one or two trees will grow from those seeds.  How would a systems thinker explain this phenomenon?**

A systems thinker could consider the other impacts of these seeds, for example their role in ecosystems. Other species might use the seeds as food, and in turn, these species may provide a useful service (e.g. removing pests). Seed production may also be used to reduce competition by covering other species of plant so they cannot grow.

**Consider the relationships between the transportation system within a city and human health.  What are four feedback loops that are evident?**

Your answer:

The easier it is to use the transportation, the more people walk, which leads to improved health. > which makes it easier to walk to transportation (if you're not unhealthy)

The more people that walk, the less people drive, which leads to less traffic, and less stressful drivers, and less traffic-related injuries. > More people walking

The more efficient the public transportation, the less pollution there is on the road, and the less asthma attacks there are, and the more people walk > more people using public transport

The more traffic on the road > the more road rage incidents > people unwilling to drive > less traffic on the road.

**What are three common properties of complex systems?**

Complex collective behavior

Signalling and information processing

Adaptation

**Describe ONE example of the adaptive cycle.**
The forest starts as a group of quick-growing seedlings feeding on nutrients (resources) from the ground (rapid growth). Growth slows as the trees reach full height, slower-growing tree species develop and there are fewer nutrients available (conservation). Gradually this forest becomes vulnerable due to its age and lack of agility. Forest fire or bug infestation causes the forest to suddenly collapse (release/disturbance). Trees fall and rot, releasing nutrients and new seeds take root, perhaps of a different species than were there previously (reorganization).

**Causal loop diagrams consist of many arrows, where each arrow connects to variables. **

Emergent behaviour of a complex system is systems behaviour that is self-organized without a controller or leader. It is the result of system components following a simple set of rules and it is often unpredictable. (Think of your personality as an emergent behaviour of the behaviour of neurons in your brain.
