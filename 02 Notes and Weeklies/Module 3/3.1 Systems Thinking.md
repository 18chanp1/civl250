# 3.1.1 Introduction
Environmental, social, and economic problems can thwart the design (and engineering) of successful, large, thriving cities, industrial manufacturing, effective resource management, and large industrial complexes.  

For example, climate change, and its associated issues, cannot be effectively addressed from the traditional engineering perspective of dividing the larger problem into predictable constituent parts then addressing each of the issues associated with each of these parts. A new way of thinking is required.  

Cartesian thinking, the foundation of the dominating engineering way of thinking, was introduced in 1662 by Rene Descartes.  There is no doubt that this traditional engineering view, also called the "reductionist", or "Cartesian" view, is a powerful mindset that has resulted in great advances regarding human health and the modern life style.  

 But the reductionist perspective assumes that the problems of the larger system will be addressed if all the problems of the system's constituent parts are solved.  We know that this is not always the case.

For example, reductionist thinking makes it difficult for the urban transportation engineer to effectively respond to the call to move away from fossil fuels as an energy source.  This is because traditional transportation engineering practices do not usually consider the influence of the urban transportation system (and its current use of fossil fuels) on our global climate system.  These traditional practices focus on the mobility of vehicles without consideration of the impacts of the transportation system on other systems (like health systems, climate systems, economic systems, ecosystems, and so on). 

Similarly, the reductionist perspective makes it difficult for the chemical engineer, working within the energy sector, to also move away from fossil fuel use as an energy source.  This is because traditional chemical engineering practice does not typically consider the impact on our global climate system of CO2 emissions due to combustion processes.  (When I was trained as a chemical engineer in the late 1980s, we thought of CO2 as a totally benign emission!) Similarly, traditional practice does not include consideration of ecosystem health, human health care systems, etc..  

**This situation does not make traditional engineering practice bad.**  On the contrary, engineering has made huge (perhaps unprecedented) contributions to human well-being across the globe!  For example, consider the terrible conditions of European cities in the 18th and 19th centuries:

Engineers now make almost miraculous contributions to public health by designing, constructing, and operating water treatment processes and other technologies resulting in dramatically lower urban death rates compared to those in cities from the turn of the last century (i.e. around 1900).

Today, engineers realize that we need to think rationally and methodically about our _larger_, more _indirect_, and _long-term_ _impacts_ on the systems which support both the modern world, and life itself!  The good news is that: 

_**We now know that a new way of thinking, i.e. thinking in terms of "complexity", is required in order to manage large, complex and every-changing, systems.**_

With its origin in biology, the systems approach to understanding the complexity of both the urban and industrial environments provides a frame for interpreting the chaotic web of variables and relationships that exist within both a city and the supply-chain of goods (i.e. the industrial and agricultural systems) that support most humans today.  

By viewing both cities and supply-chains as complex systems, we can successfully management the constituent parts of these systems for the benefit of both the parts within each system (e.g. the roads, the chemical refineries) and the larger systems (like the climate system, various social systems, or our geo-political system) in which these parts are embedded.

Fundamentally, the "systems approach" enables analysis of a sub-system (for example the energy system within a building), while keeping an eye on the context in which the sub-system is situated (for example, the social system, economic system, political system, and/or climate system, within which the building exists).

The systems approach to cities and to supply-chains starts with an understanding of complex systems theory.  

Complexity defies the reductionist perspective of breaking a larger problem into constituent parts, solving problems associated with the constituent parts, and thereby managing the larger system.  Instead, it asks us to consider self-organizing behaviour and the influence of feedback loops within systems, and interdependencies between systems. For the engineer, this means, among other issues, the systems perspective changes the way we engage in engineering decision making. 

This lesson introduces you to the ideas of systems and the theory of the systems approach. For those of you who have taken APSC 100 and 101, you may see familiar concepts, and I also hope to introduce you to more nuances associated with systems thinking.

# 3.1.2 Simple or Complex
A system is defined as a group of components that are interconnected such that they work together for a common purpose i.e. a common enterprise.

To determine if you are observing a system (instead of simply a set of stuff), ask yourself:  

1.  Can you identify _discrete elements_ (also called components, also called parts)?  If no, then you are not observing a system.  if yes, then
2.  Can you also determine if the _elements affect each other_? If so, 
3.  _Do the elements, together, generate an effect that is different from each effect of the individual element?_ 

If you answer yes to all three questions, then you are observing a system.

Systems can be categorized into simple systems and complex systems:

-   A simple system is one for which the whole is equal to the sum of its parts (there are lots of examples in the engineering world). Simple systems can usually be modelled using Newtonian physics, calculus and other normal science techniques.
-   A complex system is one for which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts (for example, you body, your brain, your family, a tree, the education system). Complexity science is the study of complex systems, which can sometimes be modelled by using post-normal science techniques (don't worry about these techniques just yet).

Urban infrastructure (served by environmental, civil, mechanical, electrical, materials and other engineering) and the supply-chain of goods (served by industrial, chemical, mechanical, electrical, mining, materials, environmental and other engineering) are both made of may different types of systems (i.e. simple systems and complex systems) that overlap and interact with other systems, including social systems, ecosystems, communication systems and more.  (You will learn more about this in the next module, when we take a look at sustainable cities.)

# 3.1.3 Systems Theory
All of us understand the world through the mental models that we (usually subconsciously) create in our brains (see: Held, C., Vosgerau, G. M-GV., Knauff, M. (2006), Mental Models and the Mind: Current Developments in Cognitive Psychology, Neuroscience and Philosophy of Mind, Google eBook, p. 5.).

Just for fun, here is a sort of bizarre (and erroneous!) mental model of how the body works:

Ok, joking aside, it is true that a _**system**_ is a type of mental model_._  Systems _**thinking**_ is a way of viewing the world around us as the interplay between multiple overlapping and/or layered systems (both complex and simple).

Especially since the end of World War II (as population and material consumption have increased - see CIVL 250 Week 1), people have found that systems theory offers a useful way of thinking about some of the phenomena related to the interactions between people and the ecosystems on which we depend (for example, see Meadows, D., Randers, O., and Meadows, D. (2004). Limits to Growth: The 30 Year Update. Google eBook.).

Perhaps it's not surprising that the ability to think of the observable world in terms of systems, that is, the ability to view the world through the lens of systems thinking, is a fundamental skill of engineering for sustainability.

# 3.1.4 Systems Thinking
Systems thinking is a world-view or perspective that focuses on observing relationships between things (including the flow of material, the flow of energy, and/or the flow of information between things), the context of these relationships, and finding recurring patterns within and between these relationships.

### _An example of the influence of systems thinking on an energy conservation strategy:_

(taken from Kay, J. (2009) Framing the Situation: Developing a System Description, Chpt 2 in D. Waltner-Toews, J. Kay, N.-E. Lister (ed.s), _The Ecosystem Approach: Complexity, Uncertainty, and Managing for Sustainability_. New York, NY: Columbia University Press.)

> The head office staff of a large power utility wanted to implement an energy conservation strategy for their office environment. Because they did not think of the equipment and lights as being part of an energy system, they did not consider the key elements of the situation and the relationships between them, i.e., they did not frame the situation. They decided to decrease power consumption by turning off unused office equipment and lights at night and on weekends. They were unaware of the building's energy system, which was designed to capture the waste heat from office devices and people, store the waste heat, then release it into the building at night. There was no other source of heat for the building other than this waste heat. Consideration was not given to energy flows throughout the building. Had the staff started the process of developing an energy conservation strategy by conceiving of the strategy as an intervention in the energy system, they might have started by framing the situation, i.e., by discovering the elements in the system, observing the relationship between these elements, being aware of the context of the situation, being aware of the processes within the system, and observing the material, energy, and information flows between the elements in the system.

_**Fundamentally, systems thinking means being aware of the interplay between a variety of different systems at different scales and with different themes.**_

_**In addition to being aware of physical structure and scale, systems thinking means being aware of context, relationships and processes, as well as being aware of patterns of behaviour.**_
