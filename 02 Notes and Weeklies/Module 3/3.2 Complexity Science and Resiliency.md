Along with cities, and sustainable supply chains, the things illustrated in Figures 1, 2, and 3, are complex systems.

You were introduced to the idea of _**complex systems**_ in Lesson 1 of this module, and you understand the relevance of _**systems thinking**_ to the design and operations of cities as well as the design and operations of sustainable supply chains. This lesson introduces you to a relatively new area of knowledge that builds on what you already know about complex systems.

Ecologists and biologists have been observing natural complex systems for a very long time and have made some very useful observations that can be applied to a variety of human-made social and built systems. Well, it turns out that physicists are just starting to develop scientific theories that describe complex systems and this basket of theories is called "complexity science" .

# 3.2.2 Synopsis
> _A complex system is a system in which large networks of components (also called "elements" or "parts"), with no central control, and with simple rules of operation, give rise to complex collective behaviour, sophisticated information processing (i.e. information flow), and adaptation via learning or evolution._

Complexity science can be thought of as the study of complex systems.  

Discussions among experts about **_complex systems theories_** and _**complexity science**_ have been on-going and even heated, particularly since the early 1980's.  While no single theory has yet been agreed upon, current complexity science tells us that complex systems have three common properties:

1.  **Complex collective behaviour**:  All complex systems consist of large networks of individual components, each typically following relatively simple rules with no central control or leader.  It is the collective actions of vast numbers of components that give rise to the complex, hard-to-predict, and changing patterns of behaviour that is so fascinating.
2.  **Signalling and information processing**:  All complex systems produce and use information and signals from both their internal and external environments.
3.  **Adaptation**:  All complex systems adapt - that is, their behaviour changes to improve their chances of survival or success - through learning or evolutionary processes.

Systems in which organized behaviours arise without an internal or external controller or leader are sometimes called "**_self-organizing_**".  Since simple rules produce complex behaviour in hard-to-predict ways, the macroscopic behaviour of such systems is sometimes called "**_emergent_**".  

For example, we can model the interactions between neurons and synapses within the human brain.  That is, we understand the rules by which these interactions occur.  It is from the microscopic behaviour of thousands of interactions between neurons and synapses within the brain that a person's personality emerges.  So, personality is an emergent, macroscopic, quality of the human brain.

Many questions arise from the study of complexity science.  A particularly interesting question asks:

> _How does the behaviour at one scale, give rise to the behaviour at the larger scale?_  

Answering this question will help us understand how human behaviour influences climate change.  It will also help us understand how physical, engineered, infrastructure influences human social systems.  

We are only at the beginning of answering the above question through complexity science.  In the meantime, we use the observations developed by ecologists and biologists to help us manage what are ever more complex infrastructure systems.  Such observations have lead us to understand that complex systems can be either resilient or not resilient.

# 3.2.3 Resilience
*Thomas Homer-Dixon is a Canadian academic who writes about resiliency and is part of the Resilience Alliance. Watch this 4 minute video to learn about the significance of resiliency to engineered systems:*

We are dependent on tech, economic, political, social, and ecological systems (pretty unresilient).

- 2003 Blackout,
- 9/11

People walking out of toronto / manhattan

Our systems are vulnerable to collapse in many ways

We need to start building resilience into our systems
- National
- Global
- Political
- Economical
- Tech (power grids)
- Personal lives
- As individuals, country, species

We are going in the opposite direction:
- 20/30 high storey buildings
	- Broken Elevators (seniors)
	- No windows can be open
	- No water on top floors
	- Windows don't open
	- Seniors in buildings could die
This is not a resilient society - brittle system

*Now watch the following 8-minute video of a talk by one of the foremost thinkers on how to create resiliency, Brian Walker:*

How much can we change before it starts to look like a different forest
This is a question on resilience

*Self Organizing systems*
All our systems are self organizing
- e.g. body - We maintain 38C temperature
	- Sweat when hot
	- Shiver when cold
	- There are limits to how much the temperature can change
Resilience is about the limits - how much we can change.
How we maintain self-organizing capacity of system

Look at a system as a ball in a pit.
![[Screenshot 2022-05-23 103510.png]]

If you excite the ball within the pit / limits, it stabilizes to equilibrium position
Otherwise, it goes to another system (pit)

Trauma surgeons create a temporary area of stability by stabilizing (e.g. blood transfusions, etc.)

After time, the peaks around the artificial stabilization decrease, so the person either dies or lives. 

When body is in suspended state, it is always trying to change. (e.g. body temp, respiration rate.)

The way we maintain resilience in system, is to allow it to probe its boundaries (e.g. 
- allowing people to go to near death rather than stabilize.)
- controlled burns in forests
- Exposing children to environment
Resilience maintained by distrubing and probing boundaries
Otherwise, the stable area becomes smaller and smaller / less shallow (easier to disturb).

Humans generally stay below 41C. There are feedbacks, physiological, that prevent that.

Ecosystems, agricultural systems understand feedback that keep itself self-organizing. 

# 3.2.4 Adaptive Cycle
Resiliency theory recognizes the nested and constantly changing nature of complex systems and offers a very simple model that broadly describes the behaviour of these systems. The model, named “the adaptive cycle” by the Resiliency Alliance (a group of scientists that has had a tremendous impact on understanding resiliency), consists of four phases:

**Rapid Growth (r)**

Social, economic or environmental resources are abundantly available and facilitate rapid growth. This phase tends to be fast.

**Conservation (K)**

Resources are no longer plentiful, slowing growth. This phase is slow with little capacity to change, making the system less flexible and vulnerable to collapse.

**Release/Disturbance (Ω)**

A disturbance causes the system to collapse. This is a quick, chaotic phase.

**Reorganization (α)**

Also a quick phase, the system may reorganize into a different structure after the collapse. New entities may be formed and innovation achieved.

**Revolt**

*Ecosystems*
Two strategies in dealing with new ecological opportunity: 
- Low capital, fast growing species
	- Take easy resources and grow quickly
- Slow growing trees come in
	- Invest large amounts of time / capital to maximally exploit environment
	- Requires the low capital to stabilize environment
	- After time, begins to overinvest in current environment
	- They are unable to change to current environment
	- Vulnerable to things like disease and fire
- A third strategy - Release / collapse
	- All the capital is released back into the environment
	- New species and relationships can form with large capital, with high growth
	- Opportunity for noveltly and recreation
- Returns back to low capital strategy, some subset of the high number of species

**This is the cycle of adaptive change**

Strategy making for non-linear transitions

This process happens to social systems too
e.g. car industry
1. Tinkerers in garage (cheap exploration of ideas)
2. Vareity of competing companies - fuel mixes, technologies, ideas
3. Consolidation - GM, Ford, Chrysler
4. Disturbance - Japanese car companies making cheaper cars, at a higher quality that is popular - cannibalize car industry
5. Reorganize - Mergers, partnerships acquisitions, strategic partnerships
	1. Lean productions, efficient companies
	2. Much more attuned to consumer desires
6. Capital into humvees, SUVs etc.
7. Failure of large companies requiring bailouts
	1. We should instead invest in new innovation (biofuels, personal rapid transit)
	2. Bailouts delay the inevitable.

# 3.2.5 Examples of Adaptive Cycles
Here are three classic examples of the adaptive cycle.

#### Example 1. The Adaptive Cycle of a Forest Ecosystem

The forest starts as a group of quick-growing seedlings feeding on nutrients (resources) from the ground (rapid growth). Growth slows as the trees reach full height, slower-growing tree species develop and there are fewer nutrients available (conservation). Gradually this forest becomes vulnerable due to its age and lack of agility. Forest fire or bug infestation causes the forest to suddenly collapse (release/disturbance). Trees fall and rot, releasing nutrients and new seeds take root, perhaps of a different species than were there previously (reorganization).

#### Example 2. The Adaptive Cycle of a Steel Bridge Design

The bridge preliminary design starts quickly using many human resources (rapid growth). The project moves to slower, detailed design with fewer human resources required (conservation). All of a sudden, steel prices spike and global supply drops (i.e. a distrubrance) and the decision is made to avoid the use of steel (collapse). A new design is started for a concrete bridge (reorganization).

#### Example 3. The Adaptive Cycle of Vancouver's Water Supply

Vancouverites pay for the provision of clean water (a resource) as part of their property taxes, with one fee per residential user paid, regardless of the volume of water consumed. Water remains plentiful (conservation), however Vancouver's population continues to grow. A very dry winter, spring and summer could spark a severe water shortage in Vancouver (disturbance), resulting in the implementation of a new water management framework with conservation and user-pay-per-volume as the new norm (reorganization).
