# 3.3.1 Introduction
The world around each of us is made of:

-   human-made physical structures as well as 
-   elements of the natural environment (like trees, rain, birds, etc),
-   social elements (like families, co-workers, and non-tangible social elements like ambition, love, pride, etc., etc.) and
-   economic elements (like money, interest rates, and enterprises of various sorts).

These photos illustrate two examples of the complexity around us.

It is complex and multi-layered, governed by webs of ecological, social, cultural, economic, and political relationships.  The human relationships operate at multiple scales, from individual households, to corporate headquarters, to resource extraction operations, to processing and manufacturing facilities, to entire metropolitan areas.  All of these interacting and evolving systems, including built systems, social systems and more, make up the urban ecology and the supply-chain of goods and services that support our existence.

Systems thinking can reveal how groups of interacting, interconnected and interdependent elements affect each other within a greater "whole".  It can provide insights into how underlying relationships drive human activity patterns and behaviours, thereby unearthing pathways to affect change and potentially resolve complex problems.

To give you a sense of how _systems thinking_ can influence engineering, this lesson focuses on a sub-set of systems within the urban ecology.  Namely, the interactions between transportation systems and human health.  This is an illustrative, fairly simple, example, aimed at helping you develop systems thinking in engineering.

# 3.3.2 Transportation and Health
The transportation system can influence people's health.  Recent research on the built environment indicates that, while people who are exposed to elements of walkability like sidewalks, connected streets, and proximity to key destinations, may not be influenced by an _individual_ element to become more active, they are, nonetheless, likely to partake in "active living" _because_ of these overall improvements to the built environment.  The more walkable environments there are within an urban environment, with diverse opportunities for physical activity (as a whole), the more likely the urban population will be healthier compared to those populations not exposed to walkable environments.  

Watch this 1 minute video to find out more about the interactions between transportation and health.

Physical inacitivty is a global epidemic.
Costs $67.5B in healthcare expenditure and productivity loss (2012)

68% adults do not meet physical activity guidelines in Canada
Costs $6.8B in direct and indirect costs

Encourage active living:
Every 10% increase in physical activity decreases healthcare costs by $150M

WHO: Active transportation one of top 100 social determinanats of health

Active Transportation and Health
- Any kind of human powered transport
- walking, cycling, incl to public transit
- Physical activity on regular basis improves physical, mental, and social health. 
- Combat effects of:
	- Physical
		- sedentary lifestyle
		- Reduce rates of diabetes
		- Reduce rates of cardiovascular disease
	- Mental
		- Endorphins - sensations of wellbeing
		- Reduce stress, anxiety, reduce risk of depression
	- Social
		- allow social cohesion between individuals
		- creating opportunities for interactions

**Reccomendations**
- Municipalities to sponsor and support workplace and school programs that encourage active commuting
	- Cheap and easy
	- e.g. count steps / distance
	- Maximize health impacts by 
		- Implemented often
		- Competitive
		- Encourge intensive activity
- Work with transit agencies to improve walkability in transit network and increase reliability
	- Activity can be met by taking transit
	- Especially transfers and walks to metro stations
	- Pedestrian infrastructure aroundd transit stations to be prioritized
	- Reliable, frequent, quality transit
	- Commuters encouraged to walk / take transit, make transfers
	- Meet daily walking requirements
- Work with provincial health authorities to shift funding from treatment to prevention
	- inactivity is epidemic and strain on healthcare system
	- initiatives that encourage active transportation rather than treatment have large payoffs
	- More effective allocation of resources. 

The above paragraph and video describe an important characteristic of a complex system:

_while individual elements within a system (for example, sidewalks, connected streets, etc.) may not influence behaviour, the group of elements together may interact in a broader pattern or arrangement to trigger a desirable outcome._  

In other words, it is the group of transportation system elements existing within a walkable environment, rather than each element on its own, which influences the activity level of individual people.

# 3.3.3 Modelling built influences
The built environment impacts human health because it influences travel behaviour, perceptions of built environment features, and access to different modes of transportation.  This is illustrated in the diagramme below.

![[pqe4ww0c.bmp]]

This diagramme, which illustrates the interactions between the built environment and human health, includes **feedback loops** marked A, B, C, and D.  For example, feedback loop A illustrates that choosing to walk increases the likelihood of good health, and improved health increases the likelihood of a person choosing to walk.  

Feedback loop B was described in the previous page of this lesson.  That is, a walkable built environment leads to more people deciding to walk, which, in turn, leads to the need for more walkable environments.

# 3.3.4 Causal Loops
Another way of presenting the systems model portrayed in the preceding page, is through a causal loop diagramme, which illustrates the systems dynamics.

![[8ui4955i.bmp]]

_A causal loop diagram depicting the feedback loop interactions between aspects of health and the built environment._

In these diagrammes, each arrow links a cause (located at the tail of the arrow) to an effect (located at the point of the arrow). The "+" or "-" sign associated with each arrow tell us that, for example, when the built environment becomes more walkable (i.e. _the "cause" increases_ in value), more people take walking trips within that built environment (i.e. _the "effect" also increases_).  Similarly, if the number of walking trips within the built environment is considered to be a cause, we can observed that increasing walking trips in a neighbourhood will result in the neighbourhood becoming more walkable. This observation suggests that more walking leads to changes in infrastructure investments leading to neighbourhood improvements.

A positive arrow also means that a decline in a cause will lead to a decline in the effect. For example, consider the positive relationship between physical health and the number of walking trips taken by citizens. When we take fewer walking trips, our physical health declines.  In other words, the number of walking trips (cause) and the level of physical health (effect) are positively aligned.  

WHAT happens if the sign associated with an arrow is negative (-)? In this case, a _decrease_ in the cause will result in an _increase_ in the effect.  Note that there are no such relationships depicted in the above diagramme. 

Causal loop diagrammes are often used by engineers to map out interactions in an ever-changing complex system in order to identify unintended consequences of design decisions.  

**_For now, you should be able to identify the similarities between the diagramme on this page and the preceding page!_**
