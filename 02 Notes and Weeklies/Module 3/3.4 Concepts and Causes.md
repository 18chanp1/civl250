# 3.4.1 Introduction
Complex systems consist of large numbers of elements and often behave in unpredictable ways. (For example, consider weather systems and climate systems.) Engineers typically address complexity by making simplifying assumptions and focusing on a small number of elements - i.e. by careful selection of system boundaries such that the the system under analysis, while complicated (e.g. a large building's heating, ventilating, and cooling system), is simple.

What do engineers do when complexity has a critical influence on an engineering decision? This is a difficult question to answer. Increasingly, engineers start by creating graphic depictions of the complexity - i.e. by creating a mental model of the complex system

In this lesson, you will learn about TWO such models. The first type of model is a concept map. The second model is one with which you are already familiar - i.e. a causal loop diagram. The purpose of introducing these types of simple graphic models to you is to add to your engineering tool kit so that you have a starting place when faced with a complex, multi-layered, value-ladened sustainability problem that requires consideration by a team of individuals each possessing a different knowledge set and of which you are a member.
# 3.4.2 Concept Maps
Here are the five characteristics of concept maps.

> **1. CONCEPTS:**  
> 
> We define _concept_ as _a perceived regularity in events or objects, or records of events or objects, designated by a label._ The label for most concepts is a word, although sometimes we use symbols such as + or %, and sometimes more than one word is used.
> 
> **2. LINKING WORDS:**  
> 
> _Propositions_ are _statements about some object or event in the universe, either naturally occurring or constructed. Propositions contain two or more concepts connected using linking words or phrases to form a meaningful statement._ Sometimes these are called semantic units, or units of meaning. Figure 1, below, shows an example of a concept map that describes the structure of concept maps and illustrates the above characteristics.
> 
> **3. CONCEPT HIERARCHIES:** 
> 
> Another characteristic of concept maps is that the concepts are represented in a hierarchical fashion with the most inclusive, most general concepts at the top of the map and the more specific, less general concepts arranged hierarchically below. The hierarchical structure for a particular domain of knowledge also depends on the context in which that knowledge is being applied or considered. Therefore, it is best to construct concept maps with reference to some particular question we seek to answer, which we have called a _focus question_.

The concept map may pertain to some situation or event that we are trying to understand through the organization of knowledge in the form of a concept map, thus **concept maps can provide the _context_ for the situation or event. (I'm not shouting here - just trying to make the connection between concept maps, engineering and sustainability.)**

Here is a concept map generated from the focus question:  What are focus maps?

**4. CROSS-LINKS:**  

Another important characteristic of concept maps is the inclusion of _cross-links_. These are relationships or links between concepts in different segments or domains of the concept map. Cross-links help us see how a concept in one domain of knowledge represented on the map is related to a concept in another domain shown on the map. In the creation of new knowledge, cross-links often represent creative leaps on the part of the knowledge producer. There are two features of concept maps that are important in the facilitation of creative thinking: the **hierarchical structure** that is represented in a good map and the ability to search for and characterize new **cross-links**.

**5. EXAMPLES:**

A final feature that may be added to concept maps is specific examples of events or objects that help to clarify the meaning of a given concept. Normally these are not included in ovals or boxes, since they are specific events or objects and do not represent concepts.

# 3.4.3 Creating concept maps
Follow these steps to create a concept map.

**STEP 1.** **Begin with a domain of knowledge** that is familiar to you (or that with which you want to _become_ familiar.)

Since concept map structures are dependent on the context in which they will be used, it is always a good idea to identify a segment of a text, a laboratory or field activity, or a particular problem or question that you are trying to understand. This creates a _context_ that will help to determine the hierarchical structure of the concept map. When you are creating your first concept maps, it's helpful to select a fairly limited domain of knowledge.  

 **NOTE THE USE OF THE FOCUS QUESTION:**  A good way to define the context for a concept map is to construct a _Focus Question_, that is, a question that clearly specifies the problem or issue the concept map should help to resolve. Every concept map responds to a focus question, and a good focus question can lead to a much richer concept map.
 
When learning to construct concept maps, _learners tend to deviate from the focus question and build a concept map that may be related to the domain, but which does not answer the question._ This is not the end of the world!  But it can make the concept map confusing.  So, it's a good idea to periodically do a check-in with the focus question to make sure that the concepts you are adding help to answer the question.  

**STEP 2.** **Create a ranked list of the key concepts** that apply to the knowledge domain you have chosen to map.
 
 Usually 15 to 25 concepts will suffice. _Start the list with the most general, most inclusive concept_, for this particular problem or situation t_hen progress to the most specific_, least general, concept at the bottom of the list.
  
Although this rank order may be only approximate, it helps to begin the process of map construction. We refer to the list of concepts as a _reservoir_ (also called a parking _lot)_, since we will move these concepts into the concept map as we determine where they fit in. Some concepts may remain in the reservoir as the map is completed if the mapmaker sees no good connection for these with other concepts in the map.

**STEP 3:** **Construct a preliminary concept map**.
This can be done by writing all of the concepts on Post-its™, or preferably by using the IHMC CmapTools (Caas _et al._, 2004b, [http://cmap.ihmc.us (Links to an external site.)](http://cmap.ihmc.us)) computer software program.  I suggest you download this software to use in creating your own concept maps.

Post-its allow a group to work on a whiteboard or butcher paper and to move concepts around easily. This is necessary as one begins to struggle with the process of building a good hierarchical organization. Computer software programs are even better in that they allow moving of concepts together with linking statements and the moving of groups of concepts and links to restructure the map. When CmapTools is used in conjunction with a computer projector, two or more individuals can easily collaborate in building a concept map and see changes as they progress in their work. CmapTools also allows for collaboration between individuals in the same room or anywhere in the world, and the maps can be built synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the mapmakers schedules.

It is important to recognize that a concept map is never finished. After a preliminary map is constructed, it is always necessary to revise this map. Other concepts can be added. Good maps usually result from three to many revisions. This is one reason why using computer software is helpful.

**STEP 4:**  **Add Cross-links**.
Once the preliminary map is built, _cross-links_ should be sought. These are links between concepts in different areas of knowledge on the map that help to illustrate how these areas are related to one another. Cross-links are important in order to show that the learner understands the relationships between the areas (also called "sub-domains") in the map.

# 3.4.4 Causual Loop Diagrams
It turns out that CLDs are just a little more complicated that what was presented in Module 3 Lesson 3. That is, the feedback loops in CLDs can be labelled as either "reinforcing" (i.e. "R") or "balancing" (i.e. "B").  A famous reinforcing feedback loop exists in the earth's climate system. Can you imagine what reinforcing loop this is? (see answer at the bottom of this page).

Here is simple example of a CLD describing water use in Nevada, U.S.A.. The reinforcing loop is labelled with an R which is encircled with an arrow. This sort of loop cannot last forever!

Answer to the climate question: Increasing GHGs in the atmosphere (e.g. CO2) leads to increased average annual global temperatures, which, in turn, lead to more water vapour (a GHG) in the atmosphere.

# 3.4.5 Reading CLDs
Ok, so for CIVL 250, you should be able to read a CLD of the following complexity.
![[742oraa7.bmp]]

Given what you already know, understanding the above CLD should be easy because you've been introduced to the causal relationship (either positive or negative) between variables, as well as balancing and reinforcing feedback loops. The only new signal in the diagram above that you have not already seen is the double slash across the arrow that, in this case, signifies a causal relationship between "food supply policies" and "natural resources capacity". The double slash indicates a significant lag time between the initial change in the first variable (which in this case is "food supply policies" and the response (either increase or decrease) in the second variable (which, in this case is "natural resources capacity").

So, make sure you are able to describe and explain:

-   which variables have direct causal relationships
-   the reinforcing feedback loops
-   the balancing feedback loops
-   the instances of significant lag times.

Also, consider these questions:

-   Can you identify which variable in the above CLD represents carrying capacity? 
-   Can you imagine an engineering intervention that might influence (i.e. benefit or harm) this food system?
