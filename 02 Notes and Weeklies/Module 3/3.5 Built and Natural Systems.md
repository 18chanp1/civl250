# 3.5.1 Introduction

So, now you know a little about:

-   _simple and complex systems, the differences between them, how to treat them (i.e. Cartesian thinking on the one hand and systems thinking on the other),_
-   _how to map complexity (i.e., by mapping both a system of knowledge using a concept map, and systems of variables using a causal loop diagram)._ 
-   _how systems thinking can influence engineering practice - recall the interactions between the transportation system and the health system, and mapping interactions between important cause-and-effect variables in a system using a CLD._  

Let's take another look at how your understanding of systems can influence your perspective of stuff in the every-day life of an engineer.

You've already "played the game" of identifying simple and complex systems.  But let's play it one more time:  please go ahead and identify each of the following systems as either simple or complex:

-   An automobile's fuel injection system
-   An automobile engine
-   An automobile
-   A road
-   A city's road system
-   A city's transportation system
-   A city

You can surely identify the systems that are obviously simple (i.e. the fuel injection system, the engine, the vehicle).  And, similarly, you know the ones that are obviously complex (i.e. a city, the city's transportation system). But are you unsure about one or perhaps two of the systems? (e.g. perhaps you think that aspects of a road system are complex (e.g. road design, and user behaviour) and other aspects are simple (e.g. the process of painting road lines - ok I don't know anything about painting road lines so maybe this is not what I imagine - please forgive this!!).) Do you see a pattern in the difference between the simple and complex systems? (Perhaps a pattern is emerging that suggests simple systems can be nested within complex systems.)

Let's take a closer look.

# 3.5.2 Examples

Here is a depiction of the large scale system that is made of the seven smaller systems described in the previous page. It is a nested hierarchy of sub-systems, and the illustration emphasizes the nestedness:
![[k4vhtyi3.bmp]]

_A Techno-Socio System. The polygons represent the system boundaries of each sub-system. The smallest sub-systems are simple systems (i.e., the behaviours of these systems are predictable). The largest sub-systems are highly complex (i.e., the behaviours of these systems are not predictable)._

Consider the context, the relationships between system components (including a variety of flows between the components), the processes, and the patterns that relate to this techno-socio system.

For example, you might want to think about the following questions:

-   With which sub-systems are traditional engineering activities typically associated?  
-   What degree of social interaction occurs within each sub-system?  
-   Can design decisions made at the level of the fuel injector reverberate throughout the entire system?
-   Is this particular large-scale system (i.e., related to transportation) similar to systems related to other manufactured products?

Take away messages from this short analysis of a techno-socio system associated with automobile manufacturing include:

1.  Traditional engineering activities often take place at the core of techno-socio systems (not surprising, is it).
2.  Categorizing a system (or sub-system) as either simple or complex can help guide which analysis tools are best used in a particular situation. For example, using the typical engineering science analysis tools you learn in your 2nd year engineering courses to solve design problems, is reasonable when you are designing a simple system (e.g. what diameter should the intake hose have). Systems tools (like concept mapping, your professional development skills, and others that you will learn about later in the course) are useful when addressing design problems related to the complexity of systems.
    

A third issue is raised by the nestedness of techno-socio systems.  That is - while the scale of the system can help determine what analysis tools to apply, systems thinking can (and perhaps should) be considered in all engineering decisions. This is because of the nestedness of systems, which indicate that interactions between systems can occur. In other words:

### _Decisions made at one scale of the system can have unintended consequences at a different scale_

For example, regarding the diagram on this page, think about how the economic system influences the material selection for car parts. Similarly, think about how the material selection of the car interior may, unintentionally, influence society's health system*.

# 3.5.3 Bio vs Techno

Not surprisingly, nestedness, as defined in the preceding pages of this lesson, exists in nature.

For example, a single plant and its community exist within an ecosystem which exists within one of the earth's biomes.  And, of course, the single plant consists of many nested sub-systems:

It's worth spending some time comparing the natural and built systems.  Consider this quote from the noted systems engineer and thermodynamicist James Kay:

"**_The most important scientific challenge facing humanity is to understand the co-evolution of the natural world and the human-constructed world that, together, form the biosphere of our planet._**"

_Kay, J. and Boyle, M. (2009). Self-Organizing, Holarchic, Open Systems (SOHOs) Chpt. 4 in D. Waltner-Toews, J. Kay, N.-E. Lister (ed.s), The Ecosystem Approach: Complexity, Uncertainty, and Managing for Sustainability. New York, NY: Columbia University Press, p. 53._

An ecosystem is a natural and highly complex system consisting of a functioning subset of biological organisms and the physical environment occupied by, and used by, the same subset. Ecologists (i.e. scientists that study the material and energy flows as well as other behaviours of ecosystems) have noted that ecosystems are adaptive – they learn. Further, ecosystems do not produce waste.

In the later part of the 20th century, environmental scientists and engineers began to conceive of human-created systems as mimicking ecosystems. Here is a table that outlines the similarities between the bio-physical environment (a bio-sphere), and the built environment (i.e., the techno-sphere).

**Biosphere**
-   Environment
-   Organism
-   Natural Product
-   Natural Selection
-   Ecosystem
-   Ecological Niche
-   Anabolism / Catabolism
-   Mutation and Selection
-   Succession
-   Adaptation
-   Food Web
-
**Technosphere**
-   Market
-   Company
-   Industrial Product
-   Competition
-   Eco-Industrial Park
-   Market Niche
-   Manufacturing / Waste Management
-   Design for Environment
-   Economic Growth
-   Innovation
-   Product Life Cycle

Thinking of an ecosystem as a metaphor for built systems (i.e., infrastructure systems, and industrial systems), bears further scrutiny.

# 3.5.4 Urban Ecology
Urban areas are dominated by people and our artifacts (like buildings, bridges and other structures, roads, and other infrastructure). But our human artifacts support species other than humans!

Because the physical landscape of urban areas is boundary-rich (i.e. there are lots of different types of land areas within a city), cities can nurture biodiversity.  - After all, boundaries imply differences, and it is from different landscapes that biodiversity arises. Further, the numbers of boundaries are compounded when one considers the differences in scale (i.e. nestedness) that exists within the urban Landscape.

Consider the human use of space in the urban environment. For example:

_In 2014, the average population density of the Netherlands was about 500 people per square kilometre (compared to 4 people/sq km in Canada and 6,900 people/sq km in Hong Kong).* Yet, on average, each square meter of land in the Netherlands is used by people for only 4 hours per year. The highest intensity of human use seems to be in shops (135hr/yr), with most people living in suburban areas where the intensity is about 48hrs/m^2/yr._

So, there are opportunities for the natural ecology to thrive within the urban setting, including boulevards and roadsides, other public spaces, as well as industrial areas where the public does not have access. In addition to these opportunities, features of the built environment, including green roofs of buildings, and more, can also provide opportunities for natural ecologies to live and grow.

The field of urban ecology is emerging as a body of knowledge that helps urban professionals, including engineers, planners, architects, landscape architects, and others, to bring sustainability into cities by applying systems thinking.

Listen to this expert explain more about the study of urban ecology.

1. Urban ecology a response to combined pressures of population growth, rapid urbanization, global environmental change
2. How to manage ecosystem sustainable
3. Understand dyanmic feedback between humans and other components in urbanized systems
4. Young field (150 yrs), grown out of traditional ecology
5. Ecology approach
	1. historical approach: pristine natural environments where humans are outsiders of system
	2. Urban ecology: 
		1. focus on human dominated landscape in urbanized regions
		2. humans as fundamental elements in the system
		3. We can study humans as any other component, like plants, animals, fungi, abiotic elements of systems
	3. Approaches in urban ecology:
		1. ecology in cities / urban regions / urban complexes
			1. Apply traditional ecology methods in urban systems
			2. e.g. interaction between urban soils and how they affect plant community structure and function in city context
			3. e.g ecological succession in urban vacant lot
		2. Ecology of cities (new)
			1. Entirely different
			2. Systems approach to studying urban social ecological systems
			3. Consider combined interactions of :
				1. social
				2. built
				3. biophysical
			4. systems approach view city as urban system
			5. systems thinking to consider ecology of entire system as ecosystem rather than within certain component in city
			6. city is the ecosystem
			7. Use social ecological systems to focus on dynamic feedback between interacting components of system
			8. allows us to understand processes, patterns of entire system
			9. Measure resilience, sustainable management
			10. Goal: Use social ecological systems approach to drive new theory of cities - empirical data / studies - focus on dynamic feedbacks between interacting components (including humans as drivers in systems) - new information and tools helps us better design policy, plans, new kinds of restoration, changes, transformations within urban systems to make them more resilient and sustainable.

So urban ecology is the study of ecology **_within_** cities but it is also the study of the ecology _**of**_ cities.  By considering the ecology of a city as a whole, we start to consider the dynamic feedbacks between the systems nested within the urban ecology. (For example, recall the reinforcing feedback loop existing between the health of community members and walkable transportation systems.)

You will learn more about the dynamic feedback loops within cities, city resiliency and sustainability, later in this course.  For now, it is enough for you to be able to:

-  define a system
-   distinguish between simple and complex systems
-   explain the difference between Cartesian thinking and systems thinking
-   demonstrate systems thinking, particularly as it relates to the interactions of the transportation systems within cities and health
-   create concept maps by following specific steps
-   analyze concept maps in terms of their components (also called "features")
-   create simple depictions of nested systems
-   compare and contrast the biosphere and the technosphere
-   compare and contrast a factory and a biological organism
-   define the field of urban ecology and explain its significance to civil engineering
