**Consider the mass flows into and out of Sydney Australia in 1990 as shown in this illustration:**

![[4.1 flows.bmp]]

**What mass flow into the city is the largest**

*Water is, by far, the largest flow!*

Indeed, water flows are critical within all cities. (Consider how large cities will cope with this need as climate change effect become more intense.)

Now take a look at the outflows from Syndey - almost all the water flowing in to the city, flows out as waste water. Looks like an opportunity for an engineering retrofit doesn't it!

Other incorrect Answers: Fuels, food, timber products.

**Consider the development of Vancouver's biking corridor along Adanac Avenue.**

**In addition to changing Vancouver's transportation system, what other systems has the Adanac biking corridor influenced? (Choose the BEST answer.)**

Vancouver's healthcare system

Other incorrect:
Vancouver's ecology
Vancouver's property tax system

**How do birds contribute to ecosystem health?**

Birds disperse seeds

The feeding habits of birds controls insect populations.

Birds provide food (e.g. eggs) for other animals.

Birds DO provide ecosystem services (e.g. they control mosquito populations).

**Describe four significant sustainability-related challenges for cities.**

Due to their increasing population density and their locations close to water or other historically relevant trading locations, cities are especially vulnerable to sustainability challenges.  The significant sustainability-related challenges listed in this lesson include:

-   disease epidemics;
-   criminal activity;
-   loss of housing affordability;
-   natural disasters such as earth quakes;
-   social dysfunction (e.g. rioting).
-   increased airborne particulates due to wild fires;
-   flooding and drought;
-   increases in storm intensity;
-   higher sea level rises leading to salinization (of soil and aquifers) and loss of underground infrastructure;
-   decreases in agricultural productivity due to loss of ecosystem services.

**Increasing resiliency of infrastructure systems in cities is now acknowledged as an effective strategy for reducing a city's vulnerability to effects of sustainability problems.**

**What are four qualities of a resilient infrastructure system?**

Resilient systems withstand, respond to, and adapt more readily to shocks and stresses, thus emerge stronger after tough times. The qualities or characteristics of resilient infrastructure systems include:

-   Reflective (i.e. learning from past experiences)
-   Robust
-   Flexible
-   Integrated (For engineered systems, this is critical and there are growing examples of this - for example, integrated waste water management is a growing field.)
-   Resourceful
-   Redundant
-   Inclusive

One principle aimed at creating resilient infrastructure systems relates to the design of infrastructure interventions: _Replace old infrastructure in such a way as to enhance or improve more than one infrastructure system_. This means that the engineer should seek to find interdependencies between built systems.

Can you think of an example of interdependency between systems?

**Under which dimension of the Cities Resilience Framework is the following driver?**

***"_Maintain protective natural and human-made assets that reduce the physical vulnerability of city systems. This includes natural systems like wetlands, beaches, mangroves and sand dunes or built infrastructure like sea walls or levees._"***

This driver describes the "Infrastructure and Environment" dimension of the Cities Resilience Framework.

You may be thinking that it's a hassle to learn a specific framework of thinking about resiliency in cities and I hear you! However, for the purposes of CIVL 250, which is an introductory course, you should be able to paraphrase the 3rd and 4th dimensions of this framework, as well as their drivers.

**Describe one example of resilient infrastructure built in Rotterdam.**

Museum park garage acts as both parking and absorbs excess water in heavy rainfall.

See notes [[4.2 Urban Infrastructure#4 2 5 Rotterdam]]


**Name one planetary boundary and explain why this boundary is important in terms of city-scale resiliency.**

If you cannot recall at least one planetary boundary, please review Tab 2.6 of this lesson.

All the planetary boundary indicators are related to city-scale resilience because of what we know about complexity science: namely, tracking planetary boundaries will help us know the planet-scale effects of our activities within cities.

 **9 Planetary boundaries**
	- climate
	- ozone depletion
	- ocean acidification
	- Nitrogen and phosphorus cycles
	- Rate of biodiversity loss
	- Freshwater use
	- Land system change
	- Atmospheric aerosol loading
	- Chemical pollution

**What is the ecosystem approach to infrastructure design?**

The ecosystem approach to infrastructure design involves consideration of the context of the design (e.g. the bio-physical context, the political context, cultural context, economic context and so on), as well as both the short and long term impacts of the design, and the direct and indirect impacts of the design. It also necessitates awareness of the systems in which the infrastructure is embedded (including the ecological, geographic, climatic systems, and the different levels of social and economic systems). finally, the ecosystem approach necessitates the considerations of the entire life cycle of the infrastructure. These considerations influence the goals of the infrastructure design.

**How does the director of sustainability and engineering on UBC campus, John Madden, view storm water management in cities?**

In addition to thinking of stormwater management as a necessity in urban design in order to avoid flooding, John Madden thinks of stormwater management as an opportunity to enhance ecosystem services within cities and to enhance the public realm, thereby improving human well-being (social and economic) and ecosystem health.
