# 4.1.1 Introduction
- Transportation of goods and resources
- Human migration
- Densification vs urban sprawl
- Population growth

Engineering is everywhere in cities: from safe drinking water to solid “waste” reuse, to electronic devices (both personal and public) to transportation infrastructure and the building inventory. What do sustainability, and the drivers for sustainability  mean with respect to the engineer’s role in supporting urban development and the urban ecology?

This lesson builds on what you learned about systems, and the idea of urban ecology, in Module 3 lessons.  It considers cities from the perspective of an urban ecologist.  You will learn a little bit about the three primary sub-systems within the urban ecology, namely:

**Very Nice**

-   the built environment
-   urban social systems
-   the bio-physical environment

# 4.1.2 Infrastructure systems
The physical infrastructure of cities can easily be thought of as interconnected and nested systems that exist at different scales and across a wide range of locations. For example, we are all familiar with the systems of streets that exist in cities.

Watch this short clip to become familiar with the many systems in which the system of city streets is nested (use the pause button if the video plays too quickly and repeat as often as you like!)

The above set of diagrammes is a slightly more detailed version of the techno-socio system described in a Module 3. Do you remember the illustration? 

In viewing cities as complex systems, urban planners have focused on the flows into and out of cities. Here is a conceptualization of the inflows and outflows of a city:![[4.1io.bmp]]

Note that thinking about mass and energy flows in this way is not new!  - especially if you are a chemical engineer, mechanical, or civil engineer, you will recognize the broader use of Newton's continuity equations!

_The point here is that, even without considering the social nature of cities, the interactions between different types of infrastructure systems within the built environment are not always well understood._  For example:

-   although the interactions between the water, buildings, and energy systems within a city  are recognized, civil engineers are only now developing tools aimed at managing these systems in an integrated fashion.  An example of such a "tool" is [Integrated Water Resource Management( (Links to an external site.)](http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/iwrm.shtml)IWRM), defined as

_"… a process which promotes the co-ordinated development and management of water, land and related resources [like energy], in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems",_ 

IWRM has been around for some years and is starting to become a well-known tool in the engineer's kit.

Because **_cities are complex, thermodynamically open, and self-organizing_**, they are often thought of as organisms in their own right. The phrase “urban metabolism” is a common way of expressing this idea. As engineers, the term is a reminder that cities are “born”, develop and grow, live in a period of stasis, and eventually decline (i.e. there is ample evidence that cities experience a cycle of life - you will learn more about life-cycle thinking in Module 5).

# 4.1.3 Urban Societies
The social systems within cities, while similar to social systems in rural settings, are unique in that, on a daily basis, they involve social interactions between strangers.  This is because **_cities bring together an array of different socio-economic, national, and professional cultures_**.  They provide opportunities to develop many types of relationships including economic, political, and many others, because of the constant flow of ideas, people, and goods into, and out of, urban areas.  

Fundamentally, social systems influence human behaviour.  Here are some examples of this influence, as well as how we can learn from social systems and human behaviour to design smart cities:

- Lane formation (pedestrian)
- Intersecting pedestrian flows
- Stop and go waves
- Crowd turbbulence
- Escape dynamics
- Clogging effect
- Creating smarter cities
- Stop and Go traffic
- Traffic simulation
- Traffic assistance
- Self-organizing traffic
- Self controlled traffic
- Emergent coordination
	- Cycle based control
	- Gap out control
- Emergence of the Homo Socialis
- Cooperating between strangers
- Conflict in Jerusalem
- Epidemic spread
- Cultural spread
- FuturICT Initiative
- 
Social systems include families, neighbourhoods, community organizations (like the local soccer club, a culture group, or local community band), volunteer organizations (like the Vancouver food bank), government, hospitals, businesses, religious organizations, and more.  (Note that these social systems vary in both size and location!) All these social systems influence peoples' behaviours! 

Both implicit and explicit rules of behaviour exist within all social systems. People's behaviours, in turn, can impact built systems and also bio-physical systems within the urban ecology. Can you think of an example of how people's behaviours impact urban infrastructure?

# 4.1.4 Livability
Vancouver has often been identified as one of the most livable cities in the world and this is due to the efforts its citizens and city professionals have made over many years to create strategies to make it so.  One example of this is Metro Vancouver's goal to support sustainable transportation choices. This means building infrastructure that enable travel modes that are alternatives to using cars to get around, i.e. more walking, bicycling, and public transport. 

In 2011, the following "baseline" travel-mode-share data was collected:

The graphic below presents estimates of the number of daily trips taken by citizens using one of six different modes: trips by transit, multiple-choice vehicles, cycling, and walking.  Travel mode-share data is collected periodically and compared to this baseline data in order to measure progress (or not!) toward achieving the organization's transportation goal.

![[4.1trips.bmp]]
Increasing travel-mode-share is just one of several strategies aimed at moving the region toward sustainability.  It turns out that tracking progress is an important aspect of sustainability - but we are getting ahead of ourselves here!

Metro Van's approach to people's mobility is a great example of how understanding the behaviour of individuals can influence built infrastructure in order to improve livability.  

To be more specific, "**_Livability_**" is the quality of interactions between people and their urban environment.  It encompasses human needs such as food, security, physical health, cultural freedom, a sense of belonging within a community, equity, and much more.   _Indicators_ of livability include:

-   air quality, 
-   walkability,
-   working conditions,
-   cultural activities,
-   sports activities,
-   volunteerism within the city's communities, 
-   and affordability of housing

_For CIVL 250, you should be able to define "Livability" and describe possible livability indicators.  You should also be able to describe an application of livability within a city._

# 4.1.5 Ecosystems Services in Cities
![Module 1 Lesson 4-5.png](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/97899/files/20865946/preview)

![[4.1ecoServices.bmp]]

Recall learning about ecosystem services in Module 1 Lesson 4. It turns out that Urban environments can support healthy ecosystems which, in turn, provide all types of ecosystem services. Below are two examples where the built system and the ecosystem impact each other within the urban ecology.

## Bats in Bristol

Wildlife, like bats, birds, squirrels, coyotes, racoons, and more, must be able to move between patches of habitat, which are often separated by paved surfaces, buildings and roads.

Bats emerge in the evening from their roosts within residential housing areas, to feed on small insects in gardens streams and other green spaces. To reach these feeding areas they travel along lines of trees which protect them from predators and high winds.

Researchers in the United Kingdom have found that bats living in Bristol are less likely to move from tree to tree if the area is brightly lit. _Who would have known!!_

The barriers caused by light can impact the health of the bat population and thereby limit the bats' ecosystem services which include reducing the mosquito populations in urban areas.

## Birds in Vancouver

Like bats, birds play an important role in the control of insects and other urban pests, such as rats. They also help to maintain ecosystems by dispersing seeds and providing food (for example eggs) for other animals. Vancouver's [Bird StrategyLinks to an external site.](http://o%09https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/vancouver-bird-strategy.pdf) aims to create an urban environment that attracts and supports native birds.

For example, by providing the following guidelines, the strategy tries to encourage bird-friendly buildings.
