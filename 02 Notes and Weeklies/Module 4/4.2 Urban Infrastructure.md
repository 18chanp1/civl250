# 4.2.1 Introduction
As the world population increases, cities are becoming ever more important – and they are amazing places! From a sustainability perspective, they have remarkable potential to support both the physical and mental well-being of well over half the world’s people. The flip side is that cities currently have large, unsustainable, eco-footprints, and most are significantly vulnerable to climate change and the impacts of biodiversity loss.

This lesson introduces you to substantial on-going activities aimed at creating resilient cities that realize their sustainability potential.

# 4.2.2 Challenges
Cities in Canada and across the globe are growing. Watch this short video to get a snapshot of the growing importance of urbanism.

Increasing amount of megacities (10M+ residents)
1950s - NY, Tokyo

1980 - + Mexico city, Sao Paulo, Osaka

2010 - 20+ Megacities across the world

2017 - 32 Mega cities

Urbanization faster than at any time in human history

Asia - 50% of all megacities

2030 - 9% of population in 41 megacities

Africa's rapid urbanization is the most rapid.

These amazing places are becoming increasingly complex hubs of innovation, exchange of goods and services, as well as places of cultural significance and human well-being. They are also increasingly vulnerable to:

-   disease epidemics;
-   criminal activity;
-   loss of housing affordability;
-   natural disasters such as earth quakes;
-   social dysfunction (e.g. rioting).
-   increased airborne particulates due to wild fires;
-   flooding and drought;
-   increases in storm intensity;
-   higher sea level rises leading to salinization (of soil and aquifers) and loss of underground infrastructure;
-   decreases in agricultural productivity due to loss of ecosystem services.

These concerns, particularly as they relate to stresses associated with climate change (and, increasingly, biodiversity loss), are being addressed by several groups around the world who are working on creating social, ecosystem, and built infrastructure resiliency in cities.

# 4.2.3 Resilience in Cities
Resilience in cities is about the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within an urban environment to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.  It involves the development of an _**integrated plan**_ to address those challenges, and to respond to them effectively.

Resiliency Theory tells us that resilient systems have specific qualities, and that for overall resiliency to be achieved, the sub-systems within a city need to possess these qualities.

#### The City Resilience Framework (CRF)

Arup*, a world famous engineering firm that is a leader in implementing sustainability ideas (and the same firm that designed the Sydney Australia Opera House), along with the Rockefeller Foundation, has developed the CRF as a way of understanding the complexity of cities and the drivers that contribute to their resilience. Investigating these drivers can help assess the extent of a city's resilience, to identify areas of weakness, and to design for improvements.

*It is well worth to have a look at Arup's website ([http://www.arup.com (Links to an external site.)](http://www.arup.com)) and also the Arup Wikipedia site ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arup_Group_Limited (Links to an external site.)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arup_Group_Limited)) (note that you will not be tested on anything on either of these websites)

![[4.2CRF.bmp]]
The CRF starts with four essential dimensions of urban resilience: 
1. Health and Wellbeing, 
2. Economy and Society, 
3. Infrastructure and Environment, and 
4. Leadership and Strategy. 
5. 
6. Each of these dimensions consists of three drivers which basically describe the actions that can be taken to improve a city's resilience.

Go to the 2.4 to discover the City Resilience Framework!

# 4.2.4 CR Framework
Here are the four dimensions of the CRF, as well as the three drivers of each dimension.

#### _1. Health and Wellbeing: Everyone living and working in the city has access to what they need to survive and thrive_

-   **Meets Basic Needs:** Particularly in times of crisis, ensure that people have access to the basic resources necessary to survive - food, water and sanitation, energy, and shelter.
-   **Supports Livelihoods and Employment:** Assist individuals to access diverse livelihood and employment opportunities, including access to business investment and social welfare. This includes skills and training, fair labour policy, and development and innovation.
-   **Ensures Public Health Services:** Provide access to effective public healthcare and emergency services to safeguard physical and mental health. This includes medical practitioners and plans, as well as clinics and ambulances.

#### _2. Economy and Society: The social and financial systems that enable urban populations to live peacefully, and act collectively._

-   **Promote Cohesive and Engaged Communities:** Create a sense of collective identity and mutual support. This includes building a sense of local identity, social networks, and safe space; promoting features of an inclusive local cultural heritage; and encouraging cultural diversity while promoting tolerance and a willingness to accept other cultures.
-   **Ensure Social Stability, Security, and Justice:** Ensure a comprehensive and inclusive approach to law enforcement and justice that fosters a stable, secure, and just society. This includes fair and transparent policing and deterrents to crime - specifically in times of crisis, as well as enforcement of laws such as codes and regulations.
-   **Foster Economic Prosperity:** Ensure the availability of funding and a vibrant economy as a result of diverse revenue streams, the ability to attract business investment, and contingency plans. This involves good governance, integration with the regional and global economy and measures to attract investment.

#### _3. Leadership and Strategy: The processes that promote effective leadership, inclusive decision-making, empowered stakeholders, and integrated planning._

-   **Promote Leadership and Effective Management:** Encourage capable leadership and effective urban management within government and civil society, particularly during an emergency. This involves strong leadership, cross-sector communication, anda evidence-based decision-making.
-   **Empower a Broad Range of Stakeholders:** Ensure that everybody is well informed, capable, and involved in their city. This includes access to information and education, communication between government and the public, knowledge transfer, and timely and appropriate monitoring.
-   **Foster Long-term and Integrated Planning:** Align sectoral plans and individual projects with the city's vision to be coordinated and appropriate to address the city's needs. This includes city strategies and plans.

#### _4. Infrastructure and Environment: The human-made and natural systems that provide critical services, protect, and connect urban assets enabling the flow of goods, services, and knowledge._

-   **Provide and Enhances Protective Natural and Human-Made Assets:** Maintain protective natural and human-made assets that reduce the physical vulnerability of city systems. This includes natural systems like wetlands, mangroves and sand dunes or built infrastructure like sea walls or levees.
-   **Ensure Continuity of Critical Services:** Actively manage and enhance natural and human-made resources. This includes designing physical infrastructure such as roads and bridges to withstand floods so that people can evacuate, as well as ecosystem management for flood risk management. It also includes emergency response plans and contingency plans that may coordinate airports to function so that relief can be lifted in and out during a crisis.
-   **Provide Reliable Communication and Mobility:** Provide a free flow of people, information, and goods. This includes information and communication networks as well as physical movement through a multimodal transport system.

# 4.2.5 Rotterdam
In 2008, Rotterdam, a city located on a river delta in The Netherlands, launched its Climate Initiative, which aims to make Rotterdam inhabitants fully resilient to climate change impacts by 2025. The Adaptation Strategy has five primary themes:

-   flood management
-   accessibility for ships and passengers
-   adaptive buildings
-   urban water systems
-   quality of life within the city

Very quickly, let's take a little closer look at how Rotterdam is making its urban water systems more resilient.

By considering the CRF dimensions and drivers while development the design goals for the redevelopment of its urban water systems, the following infrastructure has been built:

# 4.2.6 Resiliency at different scales
Systems theory and complexity science tell us that, for very large systems to be resilient, the subsystems of which the large system is made, must also be resilient. In terms of cities, this means that, if we can make cities across the world more resilient (or at least most of them!), then our human activity will positively impact the planet.

How might we check to see if systems theory and complexity science are correct on the large scale? (Not to mention the questions: how do we measuring the health of the planet?!) Listen to the following 18 minute talk by Johan Rockstrom who describes nine planetary boundaries that we need to live within. (Remember to increase the video speed as needed!).

*Video Notes*
Unprecedented pressure on systems on earth
First generation to know we are undermining ability of earth to support human development

Planetary system is too large to ignore

We must have transformative change - opens new ideas

Only period that can support human development - remarkably stable temperature.

Agrricultural - domesticated animals, etc.

Double squeezes - 
- population growth
- Climate
	- stabilize GHG
	- Avoid destabilizing ice sheets
	- 3-7m rrise
- Ecosystem Decline
	- Sharp decline of ecosystem services
	- ability to regulate climate in the long term in forrests, land and biodiversity
- Surprrise
	- Systems tip over very rapidly and unpredictably.

A new geological era
- Humans responsible for change at planetary level
- Evidence:
	- CO2 hockeystick pattern
	- NO, methanes, deforestation, overfishing, land degradation, lost of species.
	- Simultaneously branching off
	- Great acceleration of humans in 1950s
- We have to bend the curves
- Multiple stable states, seperated by thresholds
	- Depth is resilience of system
	- climate change etc. reduces resilience, so tips over easily.
	- State changes rapidly, to an undesired state
	- New biophysical system takes over, species etc
		- coral reefs - bioddiverse, low nutrient, hard coral system
		- Under impacts of unsustainable tourism, climate change, overfishing
		- Triggers system tip, loses resilience
		- Soft corals take over - undesired system that does not support socioeconomic growth
		- 
	- Arctic:
		- Appears in good state
		- 2007 - loses 30-40% of summer ice cover
		- Lock in undesired state
- We are in a precarious state
- A fence to prevent entry into danger zone
- Recognize new paradigm
	- Which are large environmental processes we need to be stewards to
	- Identify thresholds of non-linear change
	- Define planetary boundary - for safe operating space - by advances in earth system sciences
-  9 Planetary boundaries
	- climate
	- ozone depletion
	- ocean acidification
	- Nitrogen and phosphorus cycles
	- Rate of biodiversity loss
	- Freshwater use
	- Land system change
	- Atmospheric aerosol loading
	- Chemical pollution

	 - Complex and self regulation
	 - They are linked to each other
	 - Climate challenge is the easiest challenge

New paradigm to guide our industrial progress

- Transformative change is possible (innovative and transformative)
- 200 countries to simultaneously move in that direction
- Paradigm change from linear optimizations command and contral thinking to flexible and adaptive approach - redundance is key to deal with turbulent global change
- invest in persistence - social / ecological systems to absorb shocks to stay in system
- Tranformations capability - crisis to innovation 
	- rise after crisis
- Adapt to unavoidable change
- New paradigm

- Examples of success
	- Latin american agrricultural production
		- Decreasing crop yields lead to innovation
		- Farmers + scientists
		- Zero tillage systems + mulch farming
		- locally adapted technologies
		- Produces more food and sequesters carbon
		- More and more land with this adaptation
	- Australia's great barrier reef
		- Build resilence
		- acknowledge redundancy
		- Invest in system as integrated whole
		- allow more redundancy in system
	- Wetlands, sweden's urban landscapes
		- Tranform into component of urban planning

Future:
- Feeding people
	- Agriculture from producing GHG to absorb
	- Do on current land (cannot erode planetary boundaries)
	- No additional water use ()
	- Vulnerable small scale farming systems with innovation and supplementary irrrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts
	- Sustainable sanitation systems to close loop on nutrients 
	- Innovations in tillage systems
	- 2x, 3x yield of current land

We can govern the commons if we invest in trust, local action based partnerships, cross scale institutional innovations - deal with global commons on a large scale.

Low carbon economy
- Feed in tariffs in energy systems
	- guaranteed price for investment in renewables
	- subsidize electricity to poor people
	- Solve climate crisis in energy sector
	- Stimulate innovation
	- Outscaled quickly on planetary level


Key:
- We must shift our mindset
- Backcast future - what is playing field of planet
- Backtrack innovation within that
- Incremental change is not the option
- Largest tranformation within planet
- 

- simultaneously
- collaborate globally
- transformative options
- build resilience on finite planet

The TED talk you just watched (well worth the 18 minute investment of your time!) was filmed in 2010.

Fast forward to December 2015 to find that we humans (finally!) signed an international agreement (i.e. the Paris Climate agreement) and began working hard to retrofit urban environments for sustainability. We are tracking important national-level indicators and, over time, expect to see positive results. (_But recall from your climate science studies in highschool that you can expect a lag time between when we reduce GHG emissions and when we start measuring reductions in the surface temperature rise._)

**_Overall, the changes we are now creating across the globe are based on the rigorous, though still emerging, science of complexity, which is being translated into overarching goals by initiatives like the Cities Resilience Framework. These guiding documents, in turn, are informing infrastructure design goals and objectives that result in infrastructure like that being created in Rotterdam, and, of course, similar infrastructure being created in Vancouver and even at UBC._**
