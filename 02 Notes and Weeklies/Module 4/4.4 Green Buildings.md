# 4.2.1 Introduction
A core urban element in achieving GHG emission reductions is the building inventory in cities. Gradually, this inventory is being converted from conventional stock (i.e. standard buildings like the Civil Engineering Mechanical Engineering (CEME) building on the UBC campus) to so-called green buildings or high performance building.

In this lesson you will learn a little bit about how green buildings are designed. For those of you who are civil engineers or otherwise interested in a few details of green buildings, you will learn a little bit about material selection, life-cycle costing, and other somewhat technical references to buildings. This is a value-added part of CIVL 250. Go to the next Tab to learn more!

# 4.2.2 IDP
Systems thinking is changing the way professionals and disciplinary experts who create the built environment in cities do their work.

The IDP (Integrative Design Process) is a highly collaborative and interactive _design process_ that focuses on resource efficiency by employing systems thinking to derive multiple benefits from single expenditures.

![[4.4IDP.bmp]]

The IDP consists of seven stages:

-   Design Preparation
-   Evaluation
-   Conceptual Design
-   Schematic Design
-   Design Development
-   Construction Documents
-   Bidding and Construction

An eighth stage is often added, namely:

-   -   Occupancy, Operations, and Performance (sometimes called "Post-Occupancy)

**Video**
IDP incresingly influential due to link with sustainable certification processes
(e.g LEEDs/ LBCs)

When buildings take on multiple functions, that is integrated design
	e.g. floor becomes heating system / cooling system / the exposed structure

Change from conventional buildings 
	get everyone to take shared responsibility of project
	
4 quadrant point:
	1. climate
	2. system
	3. use
	4. building design
Go back and forth and check, keep entire aspect in check
When the 4 aspects are blurred, you have synthesis in the middle

Innovative solutions:
	New concepts in human architecture - rediscovering age old concepts

Integrated process:
	start blank - 
	informs architecture more
	what is the shape of the building?
	fundamental change in design process - cannot retrofit conventional buildings

Green builidngs from IDP are key aspect of climate change mititgation
	greatest solution we have
	good way to achieve carbon emission commitments
	Benefit economy, environment, community
	
Poor:
	living in houses of lowest standards
	We must improve this building stock

Benefits
	Better to live in
	less fuel to heat and cool
	reduces cost burden on them
	enhance economic position
	energy savings fundamental driver

Building is 10% of GDP
120M jobs globally

Reduced operating cost - over long term
economic impact of workers - new skills and training
Reduce / delay new power generation if you capture enough of the market

Good potential for emissions reduction

# 4.2.3 IDP Design Goals
Below are the key aspects of the IDP.

## 1. DESIGN GOALS

Different construction projects will have different design goals, but key to all projects arising from the IDP are design goals relating to:

### ENERGY:

energy use reduction or, better still, energy generation (i.e. more energy generated by the building for use elsewhere than the building uses)

### WATER:

water use reduction (or even more water captured by the building for use elsewhere than used within the building)

### MATERIAL

use of recycled and locally produced materials

### SITE

optimal use of the building site

### INDOOR QUALITY

optimal indoor quality for occupants (including air quality, sound quality, the social environment, esthetics, etc.)

## 2. PEOPLE IN THE IDP

The composition, structure, and member roles of the integrated design team will naturally be adapted to every project, with its unique context, specific constraints and opportunities, delivery methods, and client type and values. (Can you identify the UBC project for which the core team described below has been assembled?)

### CORE PROJECT TEAM MEMBERS

-   Client or owner’s representative (i.e., with expertise in facilities and operations management)
-   Project manager
-   Architect
-   IDP facilitator
-   Champion (optional) (alternatively, could be a member of the design team)
-   Structural engineer
-   Mechanical engineer
-   Simulation expert: energy modeling, thermal comfort analysis, and/ or CFD simulations.
-   Energy analysis expert: an energy engineer and/or bioclimatic engineer maybe required in order to cover the necessary areas of expertise, such as: passive solar design, renewable energy technologies, and hybrid–tech strategies
-   Electrical engineer
-   Green design specialist
-   Civil engineer with expertise in: stormwater, groundwater, rainwater, and/or wastewater systems
-   Facilities manager/Building operator (maintenance and operations)
-   Cost consultant (with experience in life-cycle costing)
-   Landscape architect
-   General contractor or construction manager.

The core team should be responsible for identifying and bringing in additional members as required depending on the project type, expertise of the core team, and client preferences.

### ADDITIONAL MEMBERS

Additional members, who may be brought in for the duration of the project or only for a few workshops, include some or all of those outlined below.

-   Ecologist
-   Occupants’ or users’ representatives
-   Building program representative, if appropriate for the building type
-   Planning/regulatory/code approvals agencies representatives
-   Interior designer/materials consultant
-   Lighting or daylighting specialist
-   Soils or geotechnical engineer
-   Commissioning agent
-   Marketing expert
-   Surveyor
-   Valuation/appraisal professional
-   Controls specialist
-   Other experts as required (e.g., natural ventilation, thermal storage, acoustic)
-   Academics and/or students with knowledge of a relevant subject
-   Members of the community who are affected by the project.

## 3. DESIGN CHARETTE

Particularly at the beginning of the design process, the leader of the design team often calls a Design Charette, which is an intensive planning session during which owners, designers and stakeholders of the project (i.e. people who are or will be affected by the project) collaborate to create an overarching vision for the project. Design charettes are called when the project is particularly large.

Ok, so you have learned a little bit about how the IDP is applied to the design of buildings. That’s enough for this course. But keep in mind that a city is made of much more than its building inventory. It turns out that, increasingly, the IDP is being applied to entire regions within cities so that it is the entire system that is optimized, not simply one component within the system.

# 4.2.4 LEED
How does a client (i.e. the private owner, or public servant neither of whom are engineers) know if a building really is high performance (also called "green")? Is the building design created using the IDP or is the building design “green wash” (i.e., the building designers don’t “walk the talk” – i.e., the building doesn’t deliver on the promises of “green”)? To address this conundrum, building certification processes have been developed, starting in the late 1990s.

## LEED

The “Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design” (LEED) process is one such certification process. It is based on a credit system where any project can be assessed to have a specific number of credits in each of several design categories. Watch this 3-minute video:

# 4.2.5 LBC
"Living Building Challenge" ([http://living-future.org/lbc (Links to an external site.)](http://living-future.org/lbc)) is another building certification system.

The Living BuildIng Challenge, which is particularly interesting, is introduced in the following 8 minute video. 

#### Video - Introduction to the Living Building Challenge

Dec 14, 2009
Seattle adopts ordinance regulating living buildings in seattle

encourages 12 living buildings to be developed in seattle

current land use code prohibhites buildings with living building characteristics

seattle city council grants department of planning and development authority to grant developers flexibility needed to meet project requirements

*Living builidings could become the next quantum leap forward in development, and based on what we learn from this pilot project, some living building standards could become the new status quo for development* ~ councilmember Sally J. Clark

Correct step, but only some imperatives of living building met

large challenge for building living buildings
	certification process has strict performance standards
	current standard is LEED - 
		challenging 
		(silver, gold, platinum)
		select elements from checklist of green building practices
		construct building
		apply for third party cert
		don't have to prove still works as LEED after architects and engineers have left
	does not consider people using the building
		plugging in electronics, lights, heaters, fans, toilet flushing

LBC
	Adhere to seven criteria
	20 imperatives - do them all
	Prove that systems are still performing as designed after 1 year of people using the building
	Imperatives:
		zero net energy
		site integrity

# 4.2.5 The Bullitt Building
Module 4 finishes with an in-depth look at one green building, completed in 2013, in downtown Seattle. Denis Hayes, the president of the Bullitt Foundation, founder of "earth day", and an engineer, gives an entertaining and informative overview of the green features of this building. (sorry but it's a 20 minute video - well worth watching in order to understand the effect of scale in the built environment).

Questions you should keep in mind while listening:

**_1. Where are the interdependencies? - 2. Where are the energy, mass, information flows? - 3. What are the interconnections with non-built aspects of the urban ecology?_**

## Video notes
### Firsts
1. First six story building that is energy neutral from PV cells
2. First office building in US to use rainwater for drinking water
3. First office building in US to infiltrate greywater to soil onsite
4. First commercial structure in US to achieve project certification from FSC - managed forests sustainably
5. First six story building in world to use composting toilets - low flush (tpsn - 1/4 cup)
