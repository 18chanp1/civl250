**What are the seven stages in the sustainable supply chain for a cotton T-Shirt?**

1.  Fibre production
2.  Spinning, weaving, dyeing
3.  Cutting, sewing, finishing
4.  Distribution
5.  Retail
6.  Use
7.  End of Life


**The annual amount of materials extracted worldwide has decreased sine (since) 1980.**
False

**What is dematerialization and what needs to occur for it to happen?**

Dematerialization is the decoupling of economic growth from natural resource consumption.

In order for dematerialization to occur:

1.  government policies need to support dematerialization. Examples of such policies include fees for the use of resources, and setting minimum warranty periods.
2.  business models need to include improved efficiency of production.
3.  greater consumer awareness so that people's behaviours are less materialistic (e.g. buy less stuff, reduce amount of air travel)

**In the most developed countries, economic growth is beginning to decouple from {}  , but increases in natural resource use continues because of  {} growth.**

**What is biomimicry?**
biomimicry is innovation inspired by nature.

See [[5.2 Biomimicry in Engineering Design]]

**Here is the design framework typically used by engineers side-by-side with the framework used by experts in biomimicry:**

**_One observation is that the both processes emphasize the need to spend time on "the front-end" of the design process. That is, understanding context, studying the problem, and "Creating" possible responses.

**_Not surprisingly, the biomimicry process is focused on natural. It's worth mentioning that the conventional engineering process, while perhaps more generic than the engineering process we are used to, does not preclude an emphasis on nature._**_**

**Which of the following is NOT one of Life's Design Principles?**

*Be self aware*

Other incorrect options:

Example:
Chemical dyes require pigments from nature, can be toxic, and require energy to process and apply.

The wings of Morpho butterflies refract light in order to create a brilliant blue colour. 

A Japanese fabric maker, Teijin Fibers Limited, created blue coloured fabric without the use of chemical dyes by creating a fabric of varying fibre thickness in a similar way that the Morpho butterfly wings are blue.

**Describe the Kalundborg Symbiosis, including it's basic concept and specific synergies.**

The symbiosis takes waste products from one industry to use in another industry, just like an ecosystem, to reduce raw material consumption and waste.

-   >1 million tons/year sludge from the Novo Nordisk pharmaceuticals manufacturing plant are used as fertilizer in nearby farms.  
-   5000 tons/yr of surplus yeast from the Novo Nordisk plant (in the production of insulin) is used by local farmers as pig food.  
-   the 1500 megawatt power station uses refinery gas from Statoil to generate electricity and steam, when is then supplied to both Statoil and Novo Nordisk for heating of their processes.  
-   135,000 tons/yr of fly ash from the power station is sent to the cement plant as a substitute for the calcium carbonate used to make cement.  
-   200,000 tons/yr of gypsum is captured by the power plant's flue gas desulfurization process and then shipped to Gyproc, which manufactures gypsum wallboard.

1. The world has to learn new ways of working together - to solve challenges we face in the 21st century  
    1. water  
    2. waste  
    3. material use  
2. New opportunities from new intelligent ways of cooperation  
    1. Further economic growth  
    2. reduce natural resource use  
    3. Save the environment  
3. KalundBorg's enterprises and authorities  
    1. located in Denmark  
    2. Largest industries are located here  
    3. Largest insulin producer (world)  
    4. Largest enzyme producer (world)  
    5. Largest water treatment plant (northern europe)  
    6. First 2nd generation bioethanol demonstration facility  
        1. Associated with Dong energy power plant in Kalundborg

4. Enterprises of KB collaborating and organizing to utilize each other's waste products in rotating local cycle   
5. Closed cycle of waste between enterprises and authorities -> unique system  
6. Residue and byproducts of one company are raw materials of another company  
7. Economic advantage  
    1. All economics based on sound business and environmental principles  
8. Similar to nature  
    1. no garbage, all output is input for a different part of an ecosystem  
    2. leaf -> soil  
9. Should be adopted by others  
10. Example of new type of cooperation that builds richer, sustainable, and harmonious world.

Within the Kalundborg Symbiosis, public and private companies buy and sell waste from each other in a closed cycle of industrial production. A variety of by-products are traded, such as steam, ash, gas, heat, sludge, and others that can be physically transported from one company to another.
