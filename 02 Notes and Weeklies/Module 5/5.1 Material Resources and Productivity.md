# 5.1.1 Introduction

A supply chain is the sequence of activities leading to the delivery of a product, or service, to an "end user". Activities include resource extraction and material manufacturing and transport, information transfer, services related to producing and delivering the product to, or service for, an end user. Each supply chain typically involves several different organizations and processes.

Here is an example of the supply chain for cotton clothing:

Increasingly, sustainable supply chains are focused on supplying people in cities! So the industrial system aims to support the urban ecology.

In Module 5, you will learn a little bit about what makes a sustainable supply chain. This lesson focuses on the current situation of per-capita consumption of materials.

# 5.1.2 Decoupling Material Consumption
In Module 1 you learned that, along with increased rates of population growth, per capita material consumption is a major effect driving our need for sustainable development.

Industrial products depend on natural resources, which, in turn, provide essential raw materials and other commodities, Natural resources are also an important source of income and jobs (Just think of Prince George B.C. as a primary example of a community dependent on natural resources). And, of course, they support the provision of ecosystem services necessary to develop human and social capital.

Consider this:

-   The amount of materials extracted worldwide has doubled since 1980, reaching close to 72 Gt in 2010, and is projected to reach 100 Gt by 2030. 
-   Materials consumption is driven primarily by construction materials (36% of OECD materials consumption in weight), fossil fuel energy carriers (28%), and biomass for food and feed (20%).

This short video explains the good news that, gradually, economic growth (or at least, economic growth in the nations belonging to the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development) is being decoupled from natural resource consumption.

**Video Notes**

1. Planet maintains equilibrium within limits
	1. Environment in which life can be sustained
2. Natural resources and raw materials provided are part of this balance
	1. The basis of our economy 
	2. Construction materials - 39% largest OECD consumption by weight
	3. Fossil Energy carriers (oil, natural gas, coal) - 28%
	4. Biomass - 20%
	5. Metal / Metal Ores - 11%
3. The more materials, the more environmental pollution
4. Some materials may becoming scarce
5. Growing of material extraction - follows economic growth
6. OECD decoupling - GDP grows, while resouce extraction reduces
	1. Peaked 18 tons / capita (1980)
	2. 17 ton / capita (2014)
	3. GDP x2
	4. 45% less material per each unit of economic output - improvement in resource productivity
7. Scale of economic output -> material pressures continue to intensify
8. Doubling of material consumption since 1980
9. Germany, Italy, Japan
	1. Decouples material consumption from GDP, absolute
	2. Reduce domestic material consumption
10. Based on 3Rs policy, not to discard waste, but can be fed back to economy
11. Municipal waste management and recycling policies essential
12. Further efforts needed
13. Encourage resource productivity by 
	1. fees for using resources
	2. fees for environmental damage
	3. support longer product lifespans by legal min. warranty periods
14. 50% warranty period increase - 50M devices avoid trashed (US)
	1. Waste reduction by 30%
15. Private sector can identify new business models linked to improved resource efficiency of production processes
16. Less materials - more value
	1. e.g. car share rental model
17. Consumers be aware of ways to contribute
	1. product choices
	2. behavior

We now know that dematerialization requires:

1. policies at all government levels (i.e. federal, provincial, Indigenous, and municipal) such as:

-   promoting integrated life-cycle-orientated approaches,
-   fees for the use of resources,
-   charges for environmental damage,
-   supporting longer product lifespans such as through increased legal minimum warranty periods

2. new business models linked to improved resource efficiency of production processes and realize that “less material” can mean “more value”.  

3. Greater consumer awareness of the role we each can play and contribute through better product choices and behaviour, for example:

-   drive internal combustion engine vehicles much much less frequently
-   significantly reduce air travel
-   buy less stuff

The good news is that, in large measure, economic growth is beginning to decouple from per capita consumption because of the work of engineers, as implied by the above illustration.

But continued use of natural resources (and consequent biodiversity loss and GHG emissions) continues because of population growth. 

The previous Tab offered actions that can be taken by governments, businesses, and individuals to reverse the overall consumption of natural resources.

But, where do engineers fit into further contributing to a sustainable supply chain? The remaining lessons in Module 5 will help you answer this question!

# Some Quiz Questions

In the most developed countries, economic growth is beginning to decouple from consumption per capita, but increases in natural resource use continues because of  population growth.
