# 5.2.1 Introduction
Biomimicry is an interesting design concept used by engineers to develop products that contribute to a sustainable supply chain.  Watch this 2 minute video to learn about biomimicry and how it can support the engineering design process.

**video notes**
1. biomimicry is innovation inspired by nature
	1. look at leaf
	2. learn how to make a better solar cell
2. popular in design disciplines because people are looking for more sustainable methods
	1. Organisms have selected good solution based on selection
	2. People take insipiration
3. Bring biologists in to see:
	1. how nature contains liquids
	2. Repel water
	3. Veins in leaf - best water distribution network
4. Murray's law - all branching structures in the world (including lungs) - follow a mathematical formula- 
		1. pipe -> branch -> pipe -> branch (decreasing diameter)
		2. Green buildings - 90 degree bends are friction devices, 
			1. consider different ways to construct water and electricity, airflow networks
			2. Mimic Murray's law
5. Sustainable world already exists
	1. Solutions to sustainability int he world around us.

# 5.2.2 Biomimicry and design
![[designProcess.bmp]]
You may be familiar with conventional engineering design process which is illustrated on the left. Notice that this process consists of 6 stages (0 through to 5) leading to a conceptual design which is then successively iterated in increasing detail.

The biomimicry design process, shown on the right, suggests a slightly different design process, consisting of four primary stages (scoping, discovering, creating, and evaluating). As you can see, each of the four biomimicry stages is made of a set of sub-stages. For example, scoping a design problem consists of :

1. defining the context of the problem

2. identifying the function that the design will perform

3. integrating life's principles into the scope of the design

Take some time to compare the two design processes. Two possible observations are provided at the bottom of this page.

Critically, the biomimicry design process makes reference to "Life's Design Principles". These principles are at the core of biomimicry design. Go to the next tab (Tab 2.3) to learn more.

_One observation is that the both processes emphasize the need to spend time on "the front-end" of the design process. That is, understanding context, studying the problem, and "Creating" possible responses._

_Not surprisingly, the biomimicry process is focused on natural. It's worth mentioning that the conventional engineering process, while perhaps more generic than the engineering process we are used to, does not preclude an emphasis on nature._ 

_What other comparisons can you make?_

# 5.2.3 Life's Design Principles
Biologists postulate that life on earth follows six design principles:

They further suggest that these 6 principles are successful within the earth's four operating conditions.

**THE EARTH'S OPERATION CONDITIONS:**

**Sunlight, water, and gravity |** **Dynamic non-equilibrium |** **Limits and boundaries |** **Cyclic processes**

_**Expectations for CIVL 250:**_ _You should be able to describe all six of these principles and also, you should be able to describe at least three examples of products that are inspired by nature._ 

The final two tabs of this introductory lesson on biomimicry offer examples of engineering designs that employ life's design principles and the biomimicry design process to create consumer products and construction materials

# 5.2.4 Consumer Products
### Example 1: Coloured Fabrics Without Chemical Dyes

([https://asknature.org/idea/morphotex-structural-colored-fibers/#.XK0wqetKg3E (Links to an external site.)](https://asknature.org/idea/morphotex-structural-colored-fibers/#.XK0wqetKg3E)

Chemical dyes require pigments from nature, can be toxic, and require energy to process and apply.

The wings of Morpho butterflies refract light in order to create a brilliant blue colour. 

A Japanese fabric maker, Teijin Fibers Limited, created blue coloured fabric without the use of chemical dyes by creating a fabric of varying fibre thickness in a similar way that the Morpho butterfly wings are blue.

### Example 2: Mussel and Gecko Adhesion

When wetted, most glues dissolve and lose their stickiness. Also, stickiness is often lost with repeated sticking and unsticking.

An adhesive has been synthesized that combines the way dry gecko feet work and the way wet mussel adhesion works, to create a product that is sticky on both wet and dry surfaces.

# 5.2.5 Self-Healing Concrete
### Example 1: Self-Healing Concrete

([https://asknature.org/idea/self-repairing-concrete-2/#.XK0n4-tKg3F (Links to an external site.)](https://asknature.org/idea/self-repairing-concrete-2/#.XK0n4-tKg3F))


Concrete is a common construction material and is known to deteriorate over time. Repairing concrete by conventional methods creates pollution and uses energy. Self-healing and self-repair is a common theme in biological systems, from trees to human skin! The less severe the "wound", the easier it is for the organism to self-repair.

"This new form of concrete uses microfibers in the place of coarser bits of sand and gravel that traditional cement mix uses. The fibers allow the final composite to bend with minimal fracturing and if fracturing does occur, the cracks tend to be less than 50 microns wide. When these tiny cracks form, the dried concrete absorbs moisture from the air. When it does this, the concrete in the crack becomes softer and eventually “grows” until the crack is filled in. At the same time, calcium ions within the crack absorb the moisture along with carbon dioxide from the air. This reaction forms a calcium carbonate material that is similar to the material found in seashells. This regrowth and solidifying of calcium carbonate renews the strength of the cracked concrete."

### Example 2: MAP Cement Making

([https://asknature.org/idea/calera-map-cement-making-process/#.XK0sgutKg3E (Links to an external site.)](https://asknature.org/idea/calera-map-cement-making-process/#.XK0sgutKg3E))

The industrial production of common cement (i.e. Portland cement) involves processing limestone (which is a carbon-fossil material) requires high heat and high pressure. Because CO2 is released from the limestone during processing and CO2 is also released as a result of burning fuel in order to create the required heat and pressure, cement manufacturing is well known to be one of the world's primary sources of GHG emissions.

The Mineralization via Aqueous Precipitation (MAP) process for making cement is inspired by coral polyps, animals that create their "homes" in a natural environment. Instead of releasing CO2, the MAP process sequesters carbon from coal-fired power plants and other gaseous waste steams containing high concentrations of GHGs.
