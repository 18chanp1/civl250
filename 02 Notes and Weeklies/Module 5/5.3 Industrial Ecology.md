# 5.3.1 Industrial Ecology
In addition to improving material and energy efficiencies of manufactured items, and applying concepts of biomimicry in engineering design to create benign processes and materials, industrial ecology is another concept that is part of an engineer's sustainability tool kit.

Industrial ecology operationalizes the idea of thinking about a factory as an industrial organism, and thinking of a set of factories (and other human activities) as an industrial ecosystem. The case study of Kalundborg is a highly successful set of human activities that illustrates an industrial ecosystem.

The Kalundborg symbiosis (note that "symbiosis" is another word for "industrial ecology") is the world's first well-functioning example of industrial ecology and a textbook example of effective resource saving and cycling of materials in industrial production. Watch this 3 minute video.

**Video Notes**
1. The world has to learn new ways of working together - to solve challenges we face in the 21st century
	1. water
	2. waste
	3. material use
2. New opportunities from new intelligent ways of cooperation
	1. Further economic growth
	2. reduce natural resource use
	3. Save the environment
3. KalundBorg's enterprises and authorities
	1. located in Denmark
	2. Largest industries are located here
	3. Largest insulin producer (world)
	4. Largest enzyme producer (world)
	5. Largest water treatment plant (northern europe)
	6. First 2nd generation bioethanol demonstration facility
		1. Associated with Dong energy power plant in Kalundborg

4. Enterprises of KB collaborating and organizing to utilize each other's waste products in rotating local cycle 
5. Closed cycle of waste between enterprises and authorities -> unique system
6. Residue and byproducts of one company are raw materials of another company
7. Economic advantage
	1. All economics based on sound business and environmental principles
8. Similar to nature
	1. no garbage, all output is input for a different part of an ecosystem
	2. leaf -> soil
9. Should be adopted by others
10. Example of new type of cooperation that builds richer, sustainable, and harmonious world.

Within the Kalundborg Symbiosis, public and private companies buy and sell waste from each other in a closed cycle of industrial production. A variety of by-products are traded, such as steam, ash, gas, heat, sludge, and others that can be physically transported from one company to another.

# 5.3.2 Material Exchange
The incentive structure of the Kalundborg Symbiosis is driven by resource scarcity, with increased costs of materials and energy for businesses being the primary basis for the shift in the method of production. Incentivisation is based on the individual project's commercial value, and any exchanges between companies are initially assessed and established on the basis of economic gain in a savings, and/or resource gains, and/or money. Biological ecosystem benefits of this relationship have become apparent and are highlighted, but the primary motivation in establishing the symbiotic relationships in Kalundborg is related to the economic benefits for participating businesses.

The figure below depicts the primary 11 activities that are interconnected in the Kalundborg Symbiosis. The symbiosis is always changing and, at any time, there are between 20 and 30 activities in the symbiosis.

Note that the power station is a coal-fired electricity generation plant.

#### Exchanges in the symbiosis include:

-   >1 million tons/year sludge from the Novo Nordisk pharmaceuticals manufacturing plant are used as fertilizer in nearby farms.
-   5000 tons/yr of surplus yeast from the Novo Nordisk plant (in the production of insulin) is used by local farmers as pig food.
-   the 1500 megawatt power station uses refinery gas from Statoil to generate electricity and steam, when is then supplied to both Statoil and Novo Nordisk for heating of their processes.
-   135,000 tons/yr of fly ash from the power station is sent to the cement plant as a substitute for the calcium carbonate used to make cement.
-   200,000 tons/yr of gypsum is captured by the power plant's flue gas desulfurization process and then shipped to Gyproc, which manufactures gypsum wallboard.

These and other synergies have resulted in significantly reduced needs for resources, including reductions of:

-   Overall water demand of between 20 and 25% (approximately 1.2 million cubic metres/year
-   oil consumption of approximate 19,000 tons/yr
-   coal consumption of approximately 30,000 tons/yr
-   CO2 emissions of 130,000 tons/yr
-   SO2 emissions of 25,000 tons/yr

Is the industrial ecology in Kalundborg a system?  Yes!

#### Optional

Convince yourself that the Kalundborg network is a system. (Can you identify discrete elements? Can you determine if the elements affect each other? Do the elements, together, generate an effect that is different from each effect of the individual elements?) Can you describe the context of the Kalundborg network? The relationships (or processes) between the elements? What are the behavioural patterns? Does feedback information flow within the network?

If you are really interested in industrial ecology, take a look at the [Handbook of Industrial Ecology (Note - you can find this book in the UBC Library)](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/a-handbook-of-industrial-ecology)

# 5.3 Industrial Ecology in a City
Industrial Ecology (IE) is a methodology of clustering manufacturing, processing, and assembly plants such that the waste stream of one industry becomes the feedstock of another industry. This idea can be used in cities where it goes by the name of "Material Flow Analysis" (MFA).

Performing an MFA is typically much more complex than trying to identify synergies for an industrial ecology, only because there are many more varied, and uncontrollable, activities happening in a city compared to an industrial manufacturing operation. Once an MFA is conducted, then possible synergies can be identified.

Here is an illustration of MFA results for Amsterdam:
