# 5.4.1 Circular economy
The idea of a circular economy builds on, and incorporates, everything you have learned so far in this module about the sustainable supply chain.

It takes us beyond the idea of a linear model for material flow and suggests a focus on _eliminating waste_ from resource and material processing (i.e. "closing the loop"), _minimizing inputs_ of new, raw materials, and _adopting renewable energy_ as a means of supporting human activities.

## Material Flows in the Urban Ecology Video
1. Vision embraced by large cities across the world
2. Growth is decoupled from finite resource consumption
3. Principles of circular economy
	1. design out waste and pollution
		1. Reveal and design out the negative, "externalities" of economic activit that cause damage to human health and natural systems. These externalities include the realse of toxic substances, GHG emissions, air, land, and water pollution, traffic congestion, low exercise, etc
	2. Keep products, components, and materials at their highest value and in use
		1. Design for reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling to keep components and materials circulating in and contributing to the economy. Circular systems favor inner loops to preserve more value, such as embedded energy and labor. Circular systems maximize use of bio based materials, extracting valuabble bio-chemical feedstocks, and cascading them into different applications
	3. Regenerate natural systems
		1. A circular economy enhances natural capital by encouraging flows of nutrients within the system and creating the conditions for regeneration of, for example, soil.

	1. Industrialize production and 3D printing of building modules
	2. Sharing and multipurpose of buildings
	3. Reuse and high-value recycling of construction components and materials
5. Dutch self sustaining eco-village
	1. circle of homes in closed loop system that produces own solar and biogass power

## 5.4.3 Video
1. A brutal year for recycling (2018)
2. China - biggest importer of recyclable materials in the world
	1. stopped accepting plastics from the world
3. 9% of world's plastic recycled.
4. 94% of blue bin are recycled in B.C. - highest rates in N.A.
5. 6%
	1. contamination - cannot be recycled
		1. e.g. greasy pizza boxes
	2. Good compared to other provinces
	3. Good education at municipal and province wide
6. Recyclables with contamination are lower quality
	1. harder to sell
	2. B.C. products easier to sell
7. Preference to sell locally
	1. Most plastics processed here
8. Companies have to pay a packaging fee for any materials that will end up in recycling
	1. 100% funded by companies putting products into the marketplace.
9. Cut down on contamination - see Recycle It BC Website

Ask yourself the following questions as you watch the video:

1. What are the principals for developing circular economies in cities?

2. What are the three opportunities to develop circularity in the construction and real estate sector in Denmark?

3. What are the barriers identified to realizing the third opportunity?

4. The City of Vancouver is planning to be a zero-waste city. In what year do they expect to achieve this goal?

5. Describe one initiative in Vancouver that is helping the city achieve its zero waste goal.

# 5.4.2 Recycling and Reusing construction waste

![[constructionMaterials.bmp]]
**The development in global use of construction materials, ores & industrial minerals, fossil energy carriers, and biomass.** _(Source: [https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/global-total-material-use-by (Links to an external site.)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/global-total-material-use-by))_

Which industrial activity uses the most material world-wide? You are right! It's the **construction industry**. 

This video explores the details of how construction materials can be recycled and reused.

## How to reuse and recycle construction materials

1. Recycled aggregates
	1. Can be produced on site
	2. From demolitions of old buildings
	3. Used for building foundations, and concrete, and asphalt
	4. Reduce biological footprint of project
	5. Additivies must be included to ensure desired binding and structural performance 
2. Asphalt Rubber
	1. ground rubber tires can be used in asphalt for aggregate
	2. Making good use of waste material
3. Metals
	1. Reinforce concrete slabs
	2. Use as edging for pavement
	3. Exist naturally, by hard to extract, exist in limited quantited worldwide
4. Rebar
	1. Manufacturing steel reinforcing bars for concrete consumes significant amounts of energy
	2. Contributor to embodied co2 emissions in infrastructure
5. Recycling metal
	1. Reclaiming and recycling metals from infrastructure deconstruction sites is commonplace
6. Post tension reinforcement
	1. Decreases virgin metal needs
	2. reduces use of steel
	3. More efficient reinforcement
	4. Reduce use of concrete (less thick) and less wood (lest formwork)
	5. Lower CO2e and construction costs from material savings
7. FSC
	1. wood harvested from sustainable managed forests increasingly popular construction material
	2. FSC - reponsible forest management practices agreed upon by wide range of stakeholders
	3. Wood products harvested from forests managed by applying FSCs 10 principles are commonly available in B.C.
8. Pine beetle wood
	1. pine beetle infested forests
	2. Used in several green buildings
		1. Richmond skating oval
		2. UBC CIRS
9. Reclaimed wood
	1. C.K. choi builduing at UBC uses wood beams from old auditorium building across the street
	2. Challenging because of unique character of each piece
10. Wood for biofuels
	1. UBC bioenergy research and demo facility
	2. Cloverdale fuels from Langley delivers 2-3 truckloads of waste wood per day
11. Masonry
	1. Common materials for walls, buildings, and site features
	2. Energy intensive to make
12. Unfired brick
	1. Green Brick, reused
	2. Feeding waste rock in raw material feed in manufacturing plants
13. Waste fired brick
	1. grog
	2. ground and use as raw material for brick making
	3. If grog is not used, ground and used as landscaping material
14. Brick veneer
	1. thickness reduced - 4in -> 3.5in -> 3in
	2. Maintains same performance
	3. Localized manufacturing saves transport costs
	4. creates local jobs
15. Concrete
	1. Mix of cement, coarse and fine aggregates, and water
	2. Easy installation and local availability
	3. Material of choice for lots of infrastructure worldwide
	4. Widely used in large water and wastewater treatment plants, pipelines, and conduits because of low cost and ability to take forms (flexibility)
	5. Accounts for 5% of global CO2e
	6. emissions intensive, fossil fuels burned to produce extreme amounts of heat to enable chemical reaction that produces cement
	7.  1 ton of cement <- 4.7 M BTUs of energy
	8. 400 lbs of coal
	9. 1 ton of CO2
	10. CO2 is byproduct of reaction that converts calcium carbonate to lime and carbon dioxide
	11. lime is turned into cement, co2 is released
	12. CaO is in form of limestone, shells, and chalk
		1. Feedstock is fossil material
		2. If not for cement production would remain underground
		3. is an unnatural additon to earth's carbon cycle in this chemical reaction
	13. An obvious place to reduce ghg emissions
	14. Replace portions of cement with other industrial waste products
		1. silica fume
		2. metakaolin
		3. slag
		4. fly ash
	15. Fly ash:
		1. cost effective and environmentally friendly
		2. 80% of CO2e associated with cement manufacturing reduced vs portland cement.
