# 5.5.1 Introduction

Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) are a type of material flow analysis based on life-cycle thinking. The assessment is performed in order to determine the environmental impact of a product, process, or system, over the lifetime of that product, process, or system.

LCAs are performed in order to understand the material inflows and outflows related to a product, process, activity, or system and the influence of those flows on receiving ecosystems.

Of course, a life cycle is a series of stages that living organisms experience, the first stage being birth and last being death. In a non-biological sense, life-cycle is typically (but not always) described as:

**_Formal LCAs_** (i.e. those that follow an internationally recognized standard protocol) are typically performed on products.

A formal LCA is performed by following 4 steps:

1.  Goal and Scope
2.  Definition Inventory
3.  Impact Assessment
4.  Interpretation

It's important to note that **_informal LCAs_ can also be performed on a mine, mill, building, and other large-scale entity**. What might a diagramme of the life cycle of a mine look like?

# 5.5.2 Goal and Scope Definition
Defining the LCA's goal and scope is the most critical step! Without a clearly articulated goal statement and definition of scope, the LCA results can be difficult to understand and even misleading. (By the way, "scope" in this context is really the boundaries of the system to be assessed.) The assessment may be performed over the entire life-cycle, or it may be performed over only one or two stages of the life cycle. Here are some questions asked during this first phase of the LCA:

-   What is the purpose of the LCA? 
-   What is the spatial and temporal scope of the LCA? 
-   What are the functional units to be assessed (i.e. what is the basis of the assessment)? 
-   Who is going to use the results of the LCA? 
-   What decisions will be made based on the results of the LCA? 

So, for example, if you are in Moonbeam's coffee shop and want to make a choice between drinking coffee from a paper or a porcelain cup, you might want to search on-line for an LCA which might help you make that decision. You would need to find an LCA where-in the purpose and scope questions are answered as follows: 

-   **Q: What is the purpose of the LCA?** 
-   A: _To determine which cup is the least environmentally damaging. (Note that the underlying assumption of LCAs is "human activity is bad for the environment". Work is now underway to modify the LCA process from the perspective of "regenerative sustainability".)_ 

-   **Q: What is the spatial and temporal scope of the LCA?** 

-   A: _The LCA will focus on the entire life cycle of those paper and porcelain cups used in Moonbeam's coffee shop. (After all, you want to make sure that the total system is optimized, not just a subset of the production system.)_ 
-   **Q: What functional unit will be used in the assessment (i.e. what is the basis of the assessment)?** 

-   A: It's p_robably best to look for an LCA where-in the functional unit involves determining the environmental impacts PER UNIT VOLUME HELD BY A SINGLE CONTAINER OVER THE LIFE-TIME OF THAT CONTAINER (not per Litre of coffee, not per weight of coffee cup material) - Think this through! - do you agree?_ 
-   **Q: Who is going to use the results of the LCA?** 

-   A: _You will use the results (so, because you are an engineering student, the language in the assessment can be fairly technical)._ 

-   **Q: What decisions will be made based on the results of the LCA?** 

-   A: _The decision will be made to drink your coffee from either the paper or the porcelain cup._ 

_Ok! I hope you get the idea!_

# 5.5.3 Inventory Analysis
Phase 2 is where the inflows and outflows to each stage are identified and measured. If you are a chemical engineer you will be very familiar with how to perform a mass and energy balance - these balances are sophisticated versions of the inventory analysis in an LCA. (Using this metaphor, each stage in the life cycle would be analogous to a unit operation in a mass and energy balance.)

For those of you not familiar with M and E balances, the inventory analysis involves identifying and measuring the materials, energy, water and pollutant inputs and outputs of each life-cycle-stage. (M and E balances are more sophisticated because they consider - in detail - events like phase changes, chemical concentration changes, chemical reactions, entropy changes, etc., that can happen within a system.)

Given our example of the coffee cup decision (i.e. where a comparison is being made), the analysis would likely be performed over the entire life cycle of each product. Care should be taken to ensure that the inventory step for each product is performed similarly. It turns out that the International Standards Organization (ISO) has defined LCA Principles and Framework to ensure that data collection methodologies are standardized and therefore valid comparisons can be made.

# 5.5.4 Impact Classification
During Step 3, each flow identified in the inventory is categorized into one of several types of impacts. A typical list of impact classifications comes from the Eco-Indicator 99 methodology:

-   Fossil Fuels 
-   Minerals 
-   Land Use 
-   Acidification and Eutrophication 
-   Exotoxicity 
-   Ozone layer 
-   Radiation 
-   Climate Change 
-   Respiratory Inorganics 
-   Respiratory Organics 
-   Carcinogens 

The classification work can be tricky. For example, two chemicals identified in the inventory step might both be carcinogenic - but even if they are present in the flows at the same amounts, their carcinogenic potency might differ! Therefore, the more carcinogenic chemical will be "weighted" more than the other. 

Once classification is complete, the results need to be normalized so that, for example, "land use" impacts can be compared to "ozone layer" impacts. 

Here is an example of the results of the Impact Assessment step for a product. The data has been weighted and normalized, and is presented according to which life cycle stage the impact occurs:

# 5.5.5 Interpretation
The interpretation step is the time to organize the goal and scope, the results of the inventory analysis and impact assessment steps, into a comprehensible package for decision makers. In fact, interpretation is best performed during each of the first 3 steps in the LCA package, so that the final step involves reviewing and finalizing the LCA deliverable.

# 5.5.6 Interpretation
The preceding Tabs in this lesson provide a brief outline of what can be involved in performing an LCA. More details is beyond the scope of this course but there are commercial courses available that will train you in the details of conducting LCAs, including how to use the various software packages that support LCA work. 

**_The learning expectation of this course is that you are able to describe the four steps of a formal LCA, including the type of questions that might be asked, and activities involved, during each step._**

Watch the following 3-minute video which reports on a comparison between the environmental impacts of recycled concrete aggregate and aggregate made from quarried rocks.

Be able to answer the following questions:

-   Why is the LCA being conducted?
-   What are the system boundaries within which impacts are being considered?
-   What is the functional unit for this LCA?
-   What are the results of the analysis?
