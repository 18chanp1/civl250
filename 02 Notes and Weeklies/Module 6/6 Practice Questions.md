LDCs are low income countries that are vulnerable to economic and environmental shock

+ criterion

See [[6.1 Introduction to Engineering and LDCs#6 1 1 The Least Developed Countries]]

**Which of the following is/are NOT a criterion used by the UN to determine which countries to designate as an LDC?**

Ecological Assets
Climate Vulnerability

*Incorrect Answers*
Income per capita
Human Assets
Economic Vulnerability

See [[6.1 Introduction to Engineering and LDCs#Video notes]]

**All LDCs are provided support to access international aid and trade.**
True

See [[6.1 Introduction to Engineering and LDCs#Video notes]]

**The World Trade Organization does not offer support to LDCs.**
False

See [[6.1 Introduction to Engineering and LDCs#Video notes]]

**What is “Humanitarian Engineering”?  Provide and example.**

EWB contributes to long term access to clean water in Malawi  
- Malawi has many water points, but up to 35% are broken  
- EWB volunteer capture where broken water points are located  
- Ensure that water points stay functional  
- Focus on GPS mapping of water infrastructure in last 6 years  
- Not working in Malawi  
- Work on helping to design a user-appropriate solution for water point mmonitoring in Malawi  
- Find innovative ways to increase functionality  
- Investing in leaders at the district government to help them more effectively respond with long term maintenance strategies  
- Need to understand complexities of village hierarchy  
- Gener roles  
- Who are the natural leaders in the community at the village level  
- People and ideas and leadership within people can change the world   
- change in a person's mindset and actions can have ripple effect on society

- not traditional NGO approach in making more water supply  
- take a step ack and look at monitoring and evaluation side

- EWB staff at the forefront  
- Look at existing infrastructure and how to expand upon it  
- Learning and drawing key lessons from what people are doing  
- comes from EWB volunteers

- Building a world of opportunity

**Consider the Jordan Water Shortage wicked problem described on Tab 6.1.2.**

**Imagine that you are a Canadian water engineer who is part of an international group charged with advising Jordan on how to approach the water shortage problem. Your group has aid funds to allocate to initiatives aimed at addressing the problem.**

**In the role of the Canadian water engineer, what, for you, is the most relevant ethical frameworks described in Tab 6.1.5? Why?**

Well, this is an open-ended question for sure. I would argue that, while there are relevant aspects of each framework that would be useful, the ethics of care framework would perhaps the most useful to the Canadian water engineer. Below is my analysis of the take-aways for the engineer that s/he might bring to the international team discussions. Since Ethics of Care has three relevant aspects, all of which might benefit the international team, I think it is the most useful framework. 

Do you agree?

Ethics of Care:

-   be sensitive to, and take into account, the local cultural, historical context, and possible language barriers. 
-   strive to create interdependent relationships between vulnerable communities and services provided through international aid.
-   be open to learning from vulnerable communities while simultaneously providing international aid.

Non-Maleficience and Beneficience

-   strive to provide benefits to the communities at hand (i.e. Jordanian communities), while simultaneously preventing harm to other communities (i.e. those in neighbouring countries).

Ethical Pluralism

-   be aware of possible similarities, and disparities between Canadian culture and Jordanian culture. Respect the ethical norms of others.

Feminism

-   Establish relationships with Jordanian communities and seek community advice and understanding - including marginalized communities.
-   Consider creating leadership opportunities for communities as part of the activities supported by the international aid.
-   Be self-aware in terms of your own biases.

# Weeklies / 7.2

Which of the following intellectual frameworks (i.e. way-of- thinking), can be particularly useful when working on a humanitarian engineering problem?

Systems thinking
Interdisciplinary thinking
Iterative thinking

Incorrect:
Focused thinking
hybrid thinking

See [[6.1 Introduction to Engineering and LDCs#6 1 2 The humanitarian engineer]],
and mainly **[[6.1 Introduction to Engineering and LDCs#6 1 4 Wicked Problems]]**

**Name and describe 4 ethical frameworks that may be of use in working on a humanitarian engineering project.**

Ethics of Care

None Maleficence and Beneficience

Ethical Pluralism

Feminism

See [[6.1 Introduction to Engineering and LDCs#6 1 5 Ethical Frameworks]]

**Consider the Jordan water shortage problem described in Tab 6.1.4. 

**Imagine that, as an expert water engineer, you are a member of an international water advisory committee for Jordan's government.**

**Which of the following options would you support in addressing and managing Jordan's water shortage?**

Liberalize the water market to achieve a water price that reflects the balance between assets and demands - i.e., increase the price of water in the region.

Nationalize the water market and limit the water usage to an entirely renewable amount (665 million cubic meters) via an equitable distribution plan within Jordan.

Build desalination plants in order to make use of the water in the Dead Sea.

Dig deeper wells in order to get hold of more ground water.

I would not support any of these solutions

Breach the "Jordan Unified Water Plan" agreement by withdrawing more water than Jordan is allocated, from the Jordan Valley.

Import water from water-rich regions of the globe where there is a water surplus.

>Any of the options shown above could be a solution, because they are all possible. The decision about which is the best response is, to a large extent, a reflection of the decision-maker's perspective.  
Note that all the possible decisions (except the "no-support" option) are governed by bio-physical constraints (e.g. like climate) and that these constraints change with time.  
The most robust decision is likely (but not necessarily) the one that best acknowledges the bio-physical constraints and, simultaneously, is supported by an array of stakeholders possessing different perspectives.  
Coming to a consensus decision is very difficult and argumentation skills can greatly help in exploring alternative solutions.
