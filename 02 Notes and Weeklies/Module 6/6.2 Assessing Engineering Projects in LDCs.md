# 6.2.1 Introduction
Imagine that you are working outside of Canada (Africa? South America? Asia? ...) for a government agency that wants to improve the lives of its impoverished citizens who inhabit an area of the world where living is really difficult.

You are part of a team consisting of people with a variety of backgrounds, from those who have expert local knowledge (like village elders), to engineers like yourself, to public health and business experts, anthropologists, and more.

The team comes up with an impactful design of some sort aimed at improving the lives of citizens in a remote area of the country. (eg, the design of a water treatment facility, or a mine, or a hydroelectric dam, or ...)

*******************************************

Now, imagine that, in order to get the funding to build the design, the team needs to demonstrate that the design is consistent with the goals and objectives of sustainable development.

#### What would you do?

Well, you could try to follow a certification protocol like the Living Building Challenge, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.  But, while these are exceptionally good assessment protocols, they really seem more suited to projects in North America than to those in the continent where you find yourself.

#### So ..... how do you begin? Where do you start?

This lesson describes an example of how one group of experts approached the problem of creating a process for assessing development projects for sustainability.

Knowing how they approached the problem, and what they came up with, could help you excel in your future professional practice (and will certainly help you do well on the CIVL 250 final!).

# 6.2.2 The Seven Questions

![[sevenQuestions.bmp]]

The Seven Questions to Sustainability, developed by the International Institute for Sustainable Development to help the mining industry, has proved to be a robust set of guidelines that, while simple to comprehend at the onset, are both credible and rigourous.  

The credibility comes from the process by which the questions were developed.  (Unfortunately, discussion of the process is beyond the scope of this course.  Suffice to say that it was a carefully crafted stakeholder engagement process.)

Rigour comes from the hierarchical framework supporting each question. The next tab explains this further.

# 6.2.3 The Framework
Underlying each of the seven questions is a complex hierarchy of ideal answers (and the associated objectives), indicators, and metrics (i.e. the data and information) that serve as a framework aimed at helping groups of stakeholders as they sort through information to make an assessment of the sustainability of an operational, or proposed, project.The high-level questions are idealistic and open-ended, but, as answers, indicators, and metrics are identified - as determined by the particular situation being assessed - the work becomes more concrete.

# 6.2.4 - Q3,Integrity of the Environment
Let's take a deep dive into Question 3, which asks:

**_Will the project or operation lead directly or indirectly to the maintenance or strengthening in the long-term of the integrity of biophysical systems so that they can continue to provide the needed support for the well-being of people and other life forms?_**

The focus of this question is the impact of the project on the biophysical system including a consideration of landscape processes over the long term.  

Example objectives for the project assessment are shown below.

The data and information base required to fully answer question 3 and address the 5 objectives shown above builds on traditional environmental impact assessment, state-of-environment reporting and ISO 14000 management system reporting requirements.  Data from these sources help determine whether or not objectives are being (or are projected to be) met.
