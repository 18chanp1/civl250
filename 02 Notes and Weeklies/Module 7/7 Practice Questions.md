**Future scenario analysis is based on the premise that the future is unpredictable, and that there are an infinite {}**


Future scenario analysis is based on the premise that the future is unpredictable, and that there are an infinite **_number of future scenarios, one of which will happen._**

**What does "scenario planning" mean?**

Scenario planning is a forecasting technique used by organizations to prepare for the long term (i.e. 10 to 30 years). It involves preparing multiple future scenarios all at once.  It asks the question: "what should we do today in order to prepare for multiple futures?"

Because it's impossible to explore the infinite number of possible and plausible futures, it's important to choose a handful of future scenarios that represent the diversity of all possible futures, that, together, capture the relevant uncertainties and possible causes of future events.

In scenario planning, there is no need to predict specific events. It's more important to identify the smaller number of possible effects that these events can trigger. For example, for a company that sources it's feedstock from a particular region of the world, any number of events (earthquakes, flood, war, etc.) may reduce the feedstock flow for the company. For the company, there is no need to predict specific events. Instead, it's important that the company prepare for what to do should their feedstock be reduced.

Traditional methods use regression or time series analysis to use current trends to predict future events. It fails because current trends often do not hold.

**Does material consumption improve human well-being?**

Yes, but only to a threshold level of consumption (i.e. people need to have food, shelter, transportation, and so on, in order to be contented). Beyond this threshold level, other things contribute to human happiness. For example, interactions with friends and family, interactions with nature, that contribute to human well-being.

Studies show that people who highly materialistic suffer from higher rates of mental and physical illness.

**What are examples of investments in public goods?**

*Use more renewable sources of energy and less fossil fuels

*Develop more efficient transportation systems.*

The overall message from Robert Costanza is that human well-being will be increased if we improve in social capital, stabilize population growth and to investment less in consumption goods and more in public goods.

**What aspect of Bhutan's government policy reflect ideas discussed by Robert Costanza?**

Fundamentally, Bhutan strives to improve GNH rather than GDP. (i.e. the government invests in education, cultural celebrations, health care, and other public goods).

**Why can leadership entail risk and danger?  What kind of problems require leadership?**

Leadership can involve risk and danger because leaders sometimes need to do things that are not popular and may result in the leader failing to achieve their goals and the goals of the people they serve. 

Problems that require exercising leadership include those that require us to change the way we behave as part of the solution to the problem. These types of problems or situations are called "adaptive" challenges or problems, i.e. problems with solutions that require people to change their behaviour.

**Please explain the way in which the following quote from Shakespeare's play Hamlet relates to adaptive leadership.**
Firstly, the quote suggests that we must have integrity, as in line 3: _Thou cans't not be false to any man._ This is a property of adaptive leadership in building trust among people.

Secondly, the quote suggests that we must be authentic, as the line: _to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day_ points out that we must act in a way that is consistent with yourself and for others, at all times.
