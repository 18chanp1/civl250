# To start adaptive leadership + iterative prc.
1.  Observing events and patterns around you;
2.  Interpreting what you are observing (i.e., developing multiple hypotheses about what is really going on);
3.  Designing interventions based on the observations and interpretations to address the adaptive challenge you have identified.

# Elements of Experience
Making sense of experience
Standing back
Repetition
Deeper honesty
'Weighing up'
Clarity
Understanding
Making Judgements

# Fundamental Attributes of Leadership
1.  **Integrity:** integrity is achieved by “honouring your word”. It develops trust among people.
2.  **Authenticity:** authenticity involves acting in a way that is consist with who you hold yourself out to be for others as well as who you hold yourself to be for yourself.
3.  **Committing to something bigger than oneself** (sound familiar? If not, then listen to Linsky again!): committing to something is a personal choice. It’s ok to choose a path that doesn’t involve being committed to something bigger than oneself! To become a leader, making this personal choice is essential.

# More adaptive Leadership
-   Successful adaptive changes build on the past rather than jettison it.
-   Organizational adaptation occurs through experimentation.
-   Adaptation relies on diversity.
-   Adaptation generates loss and is therefore difficult.
-   Adaptation takes time.

# Integrity
1.  **Do what you said:** Whatever you have said you will do or will not do, and in the case of do, doing it on time.
2.  **Do what you know:** Whatever you know to do, or not to do, and in the case of do, doing it as you know it is meant to be done and doing it on time, unless you have explicitly said to the contrary.
3.  **Do what is expected:** Whatever you are expected to do or not do (even when not explicitly expressed), and in the case of do, doing it on time, unless you have explicitly said to the contrary.
4.  **What you say is so**: Whenever you have given your word to others as to the existence of something or the state of the world, your word includes being willing to be held accountable that the others would find your evidence for what you have asserted.
5.  **Do what you say you stand for:** What you say you stand for, whether expressed in the form of a declaration made to one or more people, or even to yourself, as well as what you hold yourself out to others as standing for (formally declared or not), is a part of your word.
6.  **The social moral standards, the group ethical standards, and the governmental legal standards of both right and wrong and good and bad behaviour** - of society, groups, and governmental state in which one enjoys the benefits of membership - are also part of one's word unless:

-   one has explicitly and publicly expressed the intention to not keep one or more of these standards, and
-   one is willing to bear the cost for refusing to conform to these standards.

# Summary
-   People resist change because change often involves losing something important.  An adaptive leader, i.e. someone who is committed to something bigger than him or herself, needs to help people adjust to this loss.
-   Those who have studied leadership tell us that groups of people are willing to be influenced by trustworthy individuals who are acting, not in self-interest, but toward achieving something that is bigger than themselves.  
-   Successful leaders have integrity, keep their word, and are leading, not out of self-interest, but in order to achieve something that is important to the group they want to lead.

# Extras
 "Effective leadership does not come from mere knowledge about what successful leaders do, or by trying to emulate the characteristics or styles of noteworthy leaders, or from trying to remember and follow the steps, tips or techniques from books on coaching on leadership – and certainly not from merely being in a leadership position, or position of authority.”
