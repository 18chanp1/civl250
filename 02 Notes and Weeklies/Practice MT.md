**Consider the relationships between a city's transportation system and human health.  Which of the following has NOT been shown to be a feedback loop between these two systems?

Select the single BEST response from the list below.**

A walkable transportation system improves community mental health and an improved level of mental health within a community increases advocacy for a walkable transportation system.

Incorrect Answers
Improving health increases the likelihood of a person choosing to walk and choosing to walk further increases the likelihood of good health.
Personal health is associated with a person's improved perception of the built environment, and an improved perception of the built environment can lead to a more active lifestyle which improves a person's health.
The perception that the local area is walkable may lead to increased walking, adn increased walking may increase awareness of the walkability of an area.
A walkable transportation system increases the likelihood that a person will choose to walk, and the habit of walking may increase a person's advocacy for a walkable transportation system.

**Leslie is working with clients on a land development project. As an undergraduate student she took several courses on sustainability and engineering (including CIVL 250) and, as a practicing professional engineer, she has earned a certificate for LEED, from the Canadian Green Building Council.  

**For her clients, Leslie and her design team have created a conceptual design for a sustainable building that is cost neutral (i.e. implementation of the design won't cost any more than a standard, traditional, building design), but her clients do not want to proceed with the sustainable design because it is different from what they are used to.**  

**Which of the options in the list below is Leslie obliged by the Engineer's Code of Ethics to consider doing?  Select the single BEST response.**

Clearly explain to the clients the benefits of the sustainable design over the standard design, making reference to other sustainable designs that have already been built, then leave the final decision to the clients.

Incorrect Answers
Leave the final decision with the clients without explaining the advantages of the sustainable design.
Clearly explain to the clients the benefits of the sustainable design over the standard design, then report the clients to her professional engineering licensing association.
Clearly explain to the clients the benefits of the sustainable design over the standard design, then report the clients to a government official.
Clearly explain to the clients the benefits of the sustainable design over the standard design, making reference to other sustainable designs that have already been built, then take responsibility for moving ahead with the sustainable design, knowing that it is the best decision and that the clients will thank her later.

**In 2008, 75% of the United States corn crop was used to feed cows, chickens, and other livestock.  But, because of a 2009 change in US government policy aimed at increasing the production of renewable energy sources (in this case, corn-based ethanol), about 41% of the 2009 US corn crop was used to produce ethanol.  This increased demand for corn (due to its use as both livestock feed AND feedstock for ethanol production) led to a doubling of corn prices.

**Using your skills as a "systems thinker", identify a LIKELY UNINTENDED consequence of the 2009 change in US government policy aimed at increasing the production of renewable energy sources.**

**Select the single BEST response from the list below.**

Livestock farmers pay larger shares of their incomes to corn feed suppliers, thereby having less money to pay-down their debts, and many eventually go out of business.

Incorrect Answers
A greater proportion of available fuel in the US is renewable, therefore the rate of increase in GHG emissions in the US is reduced.
The 2009 policy has no unintended consequences.
The US water resources dwindle because of increases in irrigation needs resulting from more corn crops displacing other agriculture (like wheat).
Because renewable fuels are more accessibe, individual car owners drive more.

Incorrect Answers
On the recommendation of EGBC, the Provincial government awards provincial citations of excellence to EGBC members who have made outstanding contributions to sustainability.
